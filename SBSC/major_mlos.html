The competency area of Theory promotes an understanding of
classic and contemporary theories of society, the individual, cultures,
and economies. Students must be able to apply integrative theoretical frameworks
to explain social phenomena, especially how various aspects of social sciences
(such as individual and group behaviors, socio-economic issues cultural
and political dynamics, issues related to the analysis of gender, ethnic
groups, communities, etc.), are influenced by geographical and historical
processes. They must demonstrate this knowledge in their learning experience
and projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>

The competency area of research methodology, data analysis
and management addresses the need to apply standard <B>quantitative</B>
and <B>qualitative</B> data collection and analysis methods to social and
behavioral science issues. This requires that students learn to use modern
electronic technologies to collect, manage and retrieve social, cultural,
economic, historical, geographical, political, and psychological data.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The main objective is to provide students with an opportunity to make a
smooth transition in terms of preparation for graduate studies or professional
training in traditional universities (those that do not have an interdisciplinary
instructional focus). This area is evaluated based the assessment of a
senior portfolio that contains evidence of a student's mastery of Area
III. Learning in-depth skills within the social sciences or in areas of
professional activity can be gained in the larger society, other countries,
or the local communities. The area studies specialization helps students
gain knowledge about diverse cultures in the U.S. and of cultures outside
the U.S. Moreover, the disciplinary specialization provides students with
a foundation in traditional disciplines including anthropology, archaeology,
cultural geography, social history, political science, economics, psychology,
and sociology. This specialization, which may begin in the project based
learning labs, is formalized in the year-long senior capstone learning
experience. As an accompaniment to the senior capstone experience, there
is a directed reading lab designed to give students an exposure to both
classic and contemporary theoretical frameworks from a given discipline.
Thus, disciplinary specialization and expertise is obtained by SBS majors
through specific learning experiences in the major. Students may also propose
(via the Individual Learning Plan) study in other centers and majors that
may strengthen their preparation. This makes it feasible for our majors
to focus on interdisciplinary training, while also obtaining prerequisite
preparation for entering into graduate programs in universities with traditional
disciplinary tracks.</DT>
