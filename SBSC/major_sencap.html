<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The SBSC Senior Capstone is a highly individualized
and intensive year-long learning experience. During the year-long experience
students carry out approved projects and/or research activities. The activities
in each student's proposal is customized to meet individual educational
and career goals. In addition, the activities of the Capstone are augmented
with complimentary readings from their Senior Reading Lab (SBSC 401).</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">Explicit goals or learning outcomes are provided
for the students based on their proposal. (See below.) Aside from the explicit
goals, the nature of the Capstone activity provides the opportunity for
students to gain process-oriented skills. By successfully completing their
Senior Capstone students will not just have acquired explicit knowledge
about their field of study, but will have implicitly gained necessary real-life
skills. Some of these skills include problem-solving, critical analysis,
logical thinking, time management, and resourcefulness.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Learning Outcomes (as applicable to individual
proposals)</FONT></B>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. Ability to formulate a theoretical problem
in a researchable fashion</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. Ability to address real life problems using
theories from the social and behavioral sciences</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. Ability to generate a database and analyze
contents in light of appropriate area within the social and behavioral
sciences</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Ability to generate a database and analyze

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Ability to integrate experiential activity
with appropriate theories in the social and behavioral sciences</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6. Ability to conduct advanced critical analyses

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Demonstration of Learning Outcomes</FONT></B>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Students will be expected to submit a final comprehensive
<I>deliverable
</I>(paper,
video, CD-ROM etc.) detailing the results of their theoretical and empirical
and/or applied research. This deliverable will in turn be the subject-matter
for the oral component of the <I>graduation process</I>. In addition to
the final paper, students participating in internships will be required
to submit a <I>site evaluation form</I> and a <I>supervisor evaluation
form. </I>The culmination of products resulting from the Capstone experience
will be organized into a <I>graduation portfolio</I>. Aside from the final
capstone project, the contents of the portfolio will include items demonstrating
competency in the SBS major's three learning outcomes. (See <I>graduation</I>
<I>portfolio guidelines</I> for details.) Lastly, the student will be required
to come before their committee and present the results of their year-long
Capstone project. This typically takes place in May during the University-wide
Capstone Festival. Students graduating in December will need to make alternate
arrangements with their committee.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
