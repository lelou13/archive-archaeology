The Individual Learning Plan defines students' learning outcomes and explains
how these learning outcomes will be achieved; either by traditional coursework,
field experiences, service learning, or prior experiences in life or the
workplace. In particular, it describes what the student has done and will
do in order to become competent in the three Major Learning Outcomes required
for the SBS degree. Each ILP contains both required and optional learning
experiences.</DT>

<DT>
&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>
The ILP features learning pathways and learning experiences that help students
assess, with&nbsp; guidance from faculty and staff, their own progress
toward graduation and toward meeting their professional and career goals.
This Individual Learning Plan is essentially a contract for graduation.
Lower level students at CSUMB are introduced to the idea of outcome based
learning through the SBSC introductory experiences; they may begin drafting
their ILP in the courses SBSC 100 and SBSC 200. For upper- level students
(junior and senior transfer students), the ILP is authored during their
first semester SBSC 308 Professional Assessment Lab.</DT>

<DT>
&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>
A final Assessment Portfolio is submitted shortly before graduation. The
assessment of this portfolio evaluates the achievement of the SBS learning
outcomes. These portfolios may also provide support for the achievement
of CSUMB University Learning Requirements. The portfolio may consist of
hard copy or electronic (HTML or CD-ROM) documents which will become the
student's permanent record of achievement within the Social and Behavioral
Sciences Center at CSUMB.</DT>

<DT>
&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>
The assessment process is directed by an assessment professional. Students
may request the assistance of other CSUMB faculty members in a review of
the ILP. This assessment will include a review of any traditional (alphanumeric)
grades assigned to their courses, as well as a&nbsp; review of their performances
as articulated in the ILPs.</DT>
