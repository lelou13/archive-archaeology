    <B><FONT SIZE="+3">W</FONT></B>e have established learning requirements
    differently at CSUMB than you may be used to. Rather than graduating
    based on which courses you took, you will graduate based on what
    you have learned. Our system works a little bit like getting
    your driver's license. To get a driver's license, you need to
    demonstrate that you know how to drive and that you know the
    rules of the road. You can learn these things in a variety of
    ways, for example, taking private lessons, doing trial and error,
    or some combination. When you do get your license, you are not
    held accountable for <B>how</B> you learned to drive, but rather
    for demonstrating <B>that you are able </B>to drive. The University
    Learning Requirements are listed here.</TD>

  <H1><CENTER>The ULR System</CENTER></H1>
  <H3>How Can Students Satisfy the ULRs ?</H3>
  <P>First, a student should decide which ULR System best meets
  her or his needs. Then, for each ULR within that set, a student
  basically has three (3) choices:</P>
  
    <P>1. If a student does not already possess the knowledge and
    skills required by a ULR, then the student can register for one
    of the courses which have formally been designated as offering
    preparation and assessment for that ULR, and the student will
    be assessed by the instructor(s) right in the course.</P>
    <P>2. If the student does not already possess the required knowledge
    and skills, but he or she has a plan to gain the required knowledge
    in some way other than taking one of the designated courses,
    then the student should work out that plan with her or his advisor.
    After the student has gained the required knowledge through this
    alternative means, then the student would register for an independent
    assessment of that ULR.</P>
    <P>3. If the student believes that he or she already possess
    the knowledge and skills contained in a particular ULR, then
    the student should register for the appropriate independent assessment
    (ASMT) for that ULR. After registering for the ASMT section corresponding
    to the ULR, then the student should see the chair of that ULR
    Committee for instructions on how to prepare for the independent
    assessment.</P>

  <H1><CENTER>Goals</CENTER></H1>
  <H3>Effective and ethical communication in at least two languages
  with widely diverse audiences</H3>
  <P>This goal entails being able to identify your audience, including
  their concerns, viewpoints, and primary language; use a means
  of expression that best communicates to the audience as well
  as fits the message you wish to communicate; experience communication
  as a two-way process in which you understand what others are
  saying to you as well as communicate your own ideas effectively;
  demonstrate versatility in the language and mode of communication
  you are able to use, including oral and written modes; use technology
  appropriately as a tool to enhance the communication process;
  demonstrate a sense of ethics of your use of communication; and
  practice effective communication in collaborative work.<BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Cross-culturally competent citizenship in a pluralistic and
  global society</H3>
  <P>California provides a microcosm of the fascinating range of
  cultural diversity that makes up the U.S.; and the U.S. is only
  one of over 100 nations and hundreds of cultural traditions on
  the globe. We are interdependent, whether as individuals we choose
  to be or not. CSUMB believes that this diversity is an exciting
  and valuable human resource. Our graduates should have the skills,
  knowledge, and dispositions to establish respectful and constructive
  relationships with people who differ from themselves, understand
  how human differences become fault lines for conflict, and participate
  actively, constructively, and ethically in a culturally diverse
  society. This entails having a deep knowledge of the complexity
  and dynamic nature of culture, one&sup1;s own culture, and at
  least one or two cultures that differ from one&sup1;s own. It
  entails having skills of learning in cross-cultural contexts,
  and having formed personal relationships with people who differ
  culturally from oneself. It also entails having a sense of contemporary
  issues that relate to cross-cultural dynamics, and to various
  ways in which those issues are expressed.<BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Technological, aural, and visual literacy</H3>
  <P>Students will leave CSUMB equipped to participate effectively
  and thoughtfully in the information explosion of the 21 century.
  This means that students will become proficient at using the
  technological capabilities of settings around them, to access
  information, solve problems, create products, and communicate.
  Students will become adept at seeking out varied form sand sources
  information, evaluating it, and using it. In addition, students
  will develop the capacity to<I> read </I>the media around them
  critically, understanding what messages are being conveyed, as
  well as the viewpoints, beliefs, and assumption sin and absent
  from those messages.<BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Creative expression in the service of transforming culture</H3>
  <P>This goal is based on the fundamental premise that creating
  Art is a significant social act, and that the education of artists,
  be they painters, musicians, dancers, actors, etc. must include
  an awareness of their potential to connect with a broad audience
  and the public agenda. Understanding cultural difference and
  multiple points of view is the cornerstone of our approach to
  both history and contemporary issues. There is a social responsibility
  in making culture, and the faculty at CSUMB is committed to working
  with students in the spirit of free inquiry to help them recognize
  for themselves the implications in that responsibility.<BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Ethics, social justice, and care for one another</H3>
  <P>This goal entails being able to recognize the complexity and
  importance of choices available to humans in their personal,
  professional and social lives; conscious awareness of deeply
  held beliefs about what is important, right, wrong, good, and
  bad that affect how we relate to ourselves and others in specific
  contexts; the ability to recognize and understand others approaches
  to ethical decision making; and the ability to participate meaningfully
  and successfully in dialogues across these differences.</P>
