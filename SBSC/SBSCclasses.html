<P><B>SBSC 373 Virtual Archaeology and GIS</B>
<BR>4 credits
<BR>Virtual Archaeology is that area of archaeology that integrates multimedia
and information systems in an effort to deploy electronic and computer-assisted
technologies in the 3-D visualization, reconstruction, and modeling, and
identification of archaeological sites and materials. Because electronic
technologies have as of late revolutionized the communication and modeling
of scientific information, this course will survey the world of virtual
archaeology and visualization, and GIS applications in both prehistoric
and historic archaeology. Course applications will center on three primary
approaches to the visualization and modeling of archaeological sites and
materials, including (a) the use of multimedia applications for the reconstruction
of sites and artifacts, (b) the exploration and potential of recent applications
in 3-D visualization for archaeological site interpretation, and (c) the
use and or potential uses of GPS (Global Positioning System) and GIS (Geographic
Information System) applications and technologies in archaeology. Lower
division credit is available by registering for SBSC 273. Required of SBSC
students with a major concentration in archaeology and or museum studies.

and humans. Behaviorism and cognitive theories are studied in the context
of testing research hypothesis of the students design. This course addresses
Area II (Methods) of the SBSC MLOs. It also provides some coverage of Area
