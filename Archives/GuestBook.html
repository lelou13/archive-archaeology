<p><b>Dear Dr. Mendoza, We had to do our mission in something other than
legos. My teacher didn't want the legos. I don't know why.</b> <b>That's
okay though. We decided to build the mission with styrofom. It looks good.It
took us 7 hours. My favorit part was putting</b> <b>in the cemetary and
the jail.We took the inside of some cardboard and painted it red for the
roof. Mom wanted to by a kit but</b> <b>Iwouldn't let her! I hope you like

<p><b>Dear Aaron, Having just returned from an out of town conference,
I am just now catching up with mail messages. As for your</b> <b>questions
regarding the CSUMB curriculum, I would have you check the "Curriculum"
link on this site, and see the class</b> <b>descriptions located at: http://archaeology.monterey.edu/catalog.html.
Please note that courses are offered at different times,</b> <b>and some
courses are offered more frequently than others listed. Because the Institute
of Archaeology at CSUMB is</b> <b>interdisciplinary, you would be required
to complete an interdisciplinary core curriculum...and then work to concentrate
in your</b> <b>chosen area of archaeology. In addition to courses, you
would prepare a capstone study focusing on the subject-matter withinwhich
you wish to become most proficient. As for what you should take in the
way of courses at the secondary grade level...I</b> <b>would suggest that
you should consider taking a geology class as a matter of due course. In
addition, a computing course (if</b> <b>needed), as well as a writing course,
would prove most useful if you are to attend CSUMB or another university.
In addition, you</b> <b>may wish to consider a photography course, and
or a ceramics course...so that you can develop some of those skills that
will</b> <b>come in handy in the field and in the lab. Developing a working
knowledge of a region of the world where you would like to do</b>
<br><b>archaeology would also be of use...for example, if you wish to study
or work in the Maya region of Mexico and Central America,</b> <b>studies
specific to those countries and cultures would prepare you for field work
in those contexts. Otherwise, I hope this brief</b> <b>narrative helps...I
will have our administrative assistant forward additional materials to
you...as per your address. With Utmost</b> <b>Regards, Ruben G. Mendoza,
Ph.D., Director, CSUMB Institute of Archaeology</b>

<p><b>Dear Sir, Thank you for the posting of your wonderful story regarding
your days at Fort Ord. I am taking the liberty of</b> <b>forwarding your

<p><b>Dear Linda, Thank you for your words of support and encouragement
regarding the new SJB Historical Society web site. As for</b> <b>birth
or baptism records, I know that the Castro family goes back to the earliest
days of the Old Mission and community of San</b> <b>Juan Bautista. As such,
Castro family records would likely turn up in the original mission birth,
baptismal and death records.</b> <b>These are available through the Santa
Barbara Mission Archives, as well as by way of other sources like those
related to the</b> <b>burial records for the local cemetery...and there
are a number of Castro's buried at that site. In addition, I would like
to</b> <b>recommend that you check the Church of Latter Day Saints web
site and genealogical registers...these are among the most</b> <b>extensive
records available for most all Americans. As for the web site...we would
love to include genealogical information...and</b> <b>plan to do so in
the not too distant future. Much of that process will depend on what we
can turn up with the SJB Historical</b> <b>Society collection and contributions
of family genealogy charts by current and former San Juan residents. Finally,
you should</b> <b>note that the community of San Juan Bautista was once
called San Juan de Castro for a brief period...but eventually, the nameSan
Juan was again returned to the original name of the mission settlement
of San Juan Bautista. There isn't a book written</b> <b>about the community
of San Juan Bautista that doesn't include reference and information about
the old Castro family of San</b> <b>Juan. Also, you should know that an
effort is currently underway to preserve the old Andres Castro adobe of
Watsonville and</b> <b>vicinity. The adobe was badly damaged in the 1989
earthquake, and the owner is wishing to donate the building to the state
so</b> <b>that it may be restored. With Utmost Regards, Ruben G. Mendoza,

<p><b>Dear Dr. Mendoza, Yesterday I got to visit my old 3rd grade classroom
and give a report about you. They watched the video of</b> <b>you that
goes with the literature book and then I told them all about my visit with
you. I showed them the helmet and they asked</b> <b>me to try it on. Then
I showed them lots and lots of pictures of me and you. The asked me lots
of questions and I even had to go</b> <b>back a second day because I had
so many things to tell them. I think all of the 3rd graders were glad to
have me in there class. I</b> <b>just wanted to let you know that I got

<p><b>Dear SJB Historical Society web site visitor, I wanted to take this
opportunity to thank each of you for your kind comments and</b> <b>important
questions regarding the San Juan Bautista Historical Society web site located
at:</b> <b>http://archaeology.monterey.edu/sjbhs/index.html. Because of
recent conference commitments and other business...including my</b> <b>recent
appointment to the Board of Directors of the California Missions Foundation,
I have been delayed in responding to some</b> <b>of your varied queries.
As such, I reply in this group posting. If you require additional information,
please do not hesitate to</b> <b>contact me or Georgiana Gularte of the
SJB Historical Society. Georgiana may be contacted at: GGG.sjb95045@jps.net
Many</b> <b>of you posted questions to the address book and the email link
regarding how you might go about tracking personal family</b> <b>histories.
A number of the names that were mentioned in some of your emails are easily
recognized in the San Juan Bautista</b> <b>Historical Society collections
located at the Luck Library and Museum. Though the Luck Museum itself is
still in the process of</b> <b>being prepared for exhibitions and collections,
the collection is safely stored in the Luck Library of San Juan Bautista.
As for</b> s<b>pecific family names, the Castro, Breen, Larios, Taix, and
many other families are represented in the collections...both in termsof
documents and photographs, as well as by way of memorabilia including old
certificates (birth, death, deeds, etc), maps,</b> <b>letters, scrap books,
etc. As for how one can track birth and death records, the local cemetery
maintains a plot by plot log of all</b> <b>burials (including such families
as the Breen's and Larios') at the cemetery. In addition, a visit to the
old cemetery provides a</b> <b>great deal of information about birth and
death dates for many of those present at that location...a veritable geneology
is</b> <b>available connecting individuals and families back to about the
1850's. In addition, the Old Mission maintains birth, baptismal,</b> <b>and
death records for all that have come and gone from the parish of Old Mission
San Juan Bautista. One can access such</b> <b>records by contacting the
Old Mission, the Diocese of Monterey, by visiting the Diocese of Monterey
archives in Monterey, or</b> <b>by reviewing the actual early mission registry
of births, marriages, and deaths from as early as 1797 when the mission
was</b> <b>founded. The registries themselves may be reviewed in paper
copy in archives such as the Santa Barbara Mission Archives, the</b> <b>Bancroft
Library, or by way of contacting the geneological researchers of the Church
of Latter Day Saints...where much of thiscountries most extensive geneological
research has been completed. For the Church of Latter Day Saints, you may
wish to track</b> <b>down their web sites and inquire about specific family
names. Finally, one last possible resource for family birth, marriage,
and</b> <b>death information can be obtained from some of the early newspapers
of San Juan Bautista and Hollister that are archived with</b> <b>the San
Juan Bautista Historical Society and the Luck Library and Museum. I do
wish you the best in your respective searches</b> <b>for family history,
and invite any of you that would like to contribute to the Luck Library
and Museum archive and repository todo so by way of the San Juan Bautista
Historical Society. We invite donations of photographs, documents, and
San Juan artifacts</b> <b>and memorabilia that serves to document the early
history of San Juan Bautista and its many early California families. In</b>
<b>addition, if you would be willing to donate hardcopy or digitized images
for use on this developing web site, please contact me at</b> <b>ruben_mendoza@monterey.edu
or by phone at 831-582-3760. Your contributions to the Society, Museum,

by the Mexican</b> <b>government of that time.&nbsp; Though mission Indians
were the intended recipients of any and all mission lands, the Mexicangovernment's
conflicts with the provincial government of early California led to many
abuses.&nbsp; As a result, though much of the</b> <b>mission's properties
were confiscated and deeded away by the government, the pastor of that
time managed to hold onto a few of</b> <b>the mission's buildings, including
the church proper, and the surviving convento wing (now the museum).&nbsp;
The other wings of the</b> <b>convento quadrangle around the courtyard
(now the mission garden) were confiscated by the government and turned
into housing</b> <b>for government officials.&nbsp; Those buildings ultimately
burned to the ground, and only the mission church, chapel, and conventsurvived
the destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to answer your question, the mission was
never fully abandoned or closed...however, the</b> s<b>ecularization decree
had a major impact on the mission's ability to support itself.&nbsp; In
1865, President Abraham Lincoln deeded</b> <b>back the properties of the
Old Mission Orchard to the church, and since that time, the mission has
acted under the jurisdication</b> <b>of the Diocese of Monterey.&nbsp;
I hope that this quick history lesson will help.&nbsp; Gook luck on the
project.&nbsp; Best Wishes,&nbsp; Ruben G.</b> <b>Mendoza, Ph.D., Institute&nbsp;

<p><b>Dear Vivian, The Mutsun or Mutsune Indians were the primary native
peoples of the San Juan Bautista area. They are a</b> <b>variant of the
larger Ohlone or Costanoan Indian culture of the Central Coast of California.
You may wish to take a look at a</b> <b>book titled "The Ohlone Way: Indian
Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area." The book is by Malcolm Margolin
and</b> <b>was published by Heyday Books (Berkeley) in 1978. The Tulare
Indians that you mention were actually a central California</b> <b>group
brought to the mission during some of the many construction projects at
that mission. Both Yokuts and Tulare, as well as</b> <b>Rumsen Indians
from the presidio or fortress at Monterey were also among old San Juan
Bautista's residents. Traditionally, the</b> <b>Tulare or Tularenos were
in conflict with the Mutsun as well as with the Spanish. As for the mission
Artifact pages, I do not yet</b> <b>have images linked to those pages so
the info located there might be a bit dry...it's all database. You may
wish to check the</b> <b>"Featured Sites" section of this web site for
"Artifacts Online." The mortar and pestle pictured on that page is one
created by</b> <b>the Mutsun peoples. Well, I hope that helps for the moment...also,
be sure to check "This Old Mission" at the top of this site.</b> <b>Best
Wishes, Ruben Mendoza</b>

<p><b>I would like to be able to log onto the mission artifact website,

My son is doing a mission report of San Juan Bautista. Also, I would appreciate
any information you may have regarding</b> <b>Indian tribes that frequented/lived
at the mission. All we have been able to determin are the Tulare. Are there
others? Any info</b> <b>re Tulare or other tribes at San Juan Bautista
would be appreciated.</b>

<p><b>Dear Steven, I wanted to let you know that your last message really
made my day. Every so often, archaeologists can have a</b> <b>bad day that
turns into a whole week...I was having one of those days. I was touched
to hear that your teacher hung my last email</b> <b>message on the wall
for the Open House. Please do let your teacher and your mom know that if
you do visit Old Mission San</b> <b>Juan Bautista this summer, I would
be most honored to provide you and your guests with a personal tour of
the archaeological</b> <b>and historical areas of the Old Mission. Of course,
you will need to let me know ahead of time about when you might be out
so</b> <b>that I can plan ahead. Best wishes and good luck with your digs
and your place on third base! With Utmost Regards, Ruben</b> <b>Mendoza,

<p><b>Dr. Mendoza: Thanks for replying to me last week. I took your email
in to class and the teacher hung it up for Open House. My</b> <b>mom was
proud of me. In our literature book it has an interview of you, and my
mom told me that if I did all of my chores this</b> <b>week she would buy
me your book Time Dectective. I am glad we read about you. Next week we
have Easter vacation, and my</b> <b>mom is taking me to some of the california
missions not too far from here since now I am interested in them because
of you. We</b> <b>look on the internet at pictures of the mission where
you are digging. She said maybe this summer she would take me up there
to</b> <b>see your mission. She's a teacher, so she will be on vacation
to. We are going to my baseball game right now. I play thrid base.Thank
you again for writing to me.</b>

<p><b>Dear Steven, My students and I have recovered everything from Spanish
and Mexican cannonballs to Mutsune Indian shell</b> <b>crosses and French
and British porcelains or ceramics. We have also excavated the old well
that once provided water to the</b> <b>mission, and the foundations for
two entire buildings. We have determined that the buildings probably burned
to the ground</b> <b>sometime around the 1830's (over 170 years ago)...and
that the burning was probably due to a raid that resulted in a fire. Cannonballs,
musket balls, and Indian arrowheads were found in the burned out buildings.
Hope you do well on your excavation...you</b> <b>may wish to ask your teacher
for a children's book that I prepared. It was published by Scholastic Inc.,
and is titled "Time</b> <b>Detective." There is also a video and a CD-ROM
that accompany the book. I'm also working on a childrens book for McGraw</b>
<b>Hill's "Science 2000" series. Good luck with your digs! Sincerely, Ruben
