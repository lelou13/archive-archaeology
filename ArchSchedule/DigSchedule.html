<hr WIDTH="100%"></font></b><font color="#000000">The following links will
provide the most up to date schedule of archaeology lab and dig days sponsored
by the CSUMB Institute of Archaeology.&nbsp; Each lab or dig day is supervised
and mentored by Professor Ruben Mendoza in his capacity as the director
of the Institute of Archaeology.&nbsp; It should be noted that this schedule
is subject to change in the event of unforseen circumstances or weather-related
conditions.&nbsp; When in doubt, those who are either current students
or project volunteers on the Institute email list -- who have completed
the necessary paperwork for release and liability and personal information
purposes -- should check their email for messages and announcements regarding
any last minute changes in the schedule.&nbsp; Otherwise, the excavation
days begin at 8:30 a.m. in the courtyard at Old Mission San Juan Bautista,
California; and the archaeology lab days take place in Building 110 of
the CSU Monterey Bay campus.&nbsp; If you have any additional questions
regarding locations and days, please feel free to contact the Institute
Director at: ruben_mendoza@monterey.edu.</font>

<p><b><a href="Sp2001Digs.html">Spring 2001</a>:</b> The principal area
of excavation at this time is centered on the outer portrion of the exterior
wall of the Southwest Convento wing of the Old Mission Quadrangle.&nbsp;
Secondary efforts are directed at the continuing recovery of artifacts
and the exposure of the original mission well.&nbsp; The current efforts
are being undertaken by SBSM 397 (Independent Study: Field Archaeology)
students and project volunteers.
<p><b>Fall 2000:</b> Excavations during the Fall of 2000 were directed
at (a) the excavations of the outer portrion of the exterior wall of the
Southwest Convento wing of the Old Mission Quadrangle, (b) the interior
corner (wall foundation) of the western-most portion of the Old Mission
Quadrangle, (c) the exterior portion of the Feature 4 (Torreon) wall foundation
located at the southernmost portion of the Old Mission Quadrangle, and
(d) the continuing recovery of artifacts and the exposure of the original
mission well.&nbsp; These objectives were the product of the conjoined
efforts of the SBSD 224s/324s (Archaeology: Map to Museum -- project option),
and SBSD 250s/350s (Archaeology of a California Mission) students. <b><font color="#CC0000">[Schedule]</font></b></blockquote>
