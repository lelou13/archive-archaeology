<B>Introduction</B>
<P>On June 24th, 1997, the community of San Juan Bautista celebrated the
200th anniversary of the Old Mission’s founding by Father Fermin Francisco
de Lasuen.&nbsp; Between June 21st and 24th of 1997, the Old Mission and
community of San Juan Bautista celebrated with an early morning mass, a
Mutsun Indian religious blessing, Native American dances, an Old Timers
parade, a rededication of the original Chapel of 1799, and a host of activities
generally associated with the annual Fiesta Pageant or Old Mission’s annual
celebration and carnival that originated shortly after the 1906 earthquake
that damaged portions of the Old Mission’s original monastery and church
side aisles.&nbsp; The many thousands of visitors and participants who
converged on San Juan for the events of the Old Mission’s bicentennial
celebration were there to celebrate more than the passing of 200 years
in the mission’s history, they had come to relive the many events, rekindle
the friendships, and celebrate the life history of a community that has
seemingly survived the centuries unscathed by the progress and development
that has transformed many of the original Spanish colonial settlements
within which the missions were originally founded.
<P><B>The Historic Setting</B>
<P>&nbsp;The unique historic setting of the Old Mission and community of
San Juan Bautista is one that has received little attention over the years.&nbsp;
Despite the fact that San Juan, as it was originally known, was the principal
crossroads of the original Spanish, and later, Mexican and American “entradas”
or expeditions to and from the interior of Alta or Upper California, and
would for a time serve as the seat of Upper California, San Juan Bautista
has often suffered at the hands of historians and writers who have largely
excluded this ancient community from the broader history of California.&nbsp;
Situated as it is on the only surviving “intact” Spanish colonial-era plaza
in California and the American Southwest, and perched atop the great ledge
of the Pacific Plate of the great San Andreas Fault, the community and
mission of San Juan Bautista are unique from both an historic as well as
a geological standpoint.&nbsp; As such, the diverse mix of peoples and
cultures of San Juan and San Benito County continue to provide unique insights
and a general snapshot of the culture and character of California and its
origins.
<P><B>The Learning Experience</B>
<P>For these reasons, including the historical integrity of the Old Mission
and its colonial era plaza, its unique geological and cultural setting,
and its pristine setting and importance in California history, the Old
Mission -- and adjacent State Historic Park plaza and adobe buildings --
has long held importance as a primary destination for Fourth Grade students
from throughout California.&nbsp; According to the San Juan State Historic
Park Ranger’s office, some 40,000 to 60,000 Fourth Grade students and teachers
visit the Old Mission and State Park on school field trips on an annual
basis.&nbsp; The Hollister Freelance in turn estimates that some 400,000
tourists visit the Old Mission on an annual basis.&nbsp; Such tours generally
begin with a tour of the Old Mission and proceed from there to the Plaza
Hotel, and continue through the Castro-Breen Adobe, the Livery Stable and
Zanetta House, the Old Jail, and the Vicki Cottage and adjacent gardens.&nbsp;
The educational field trips in question are part of the State-mandated
California history studies requirement for all Fourth Grade students.&nbsp;
In 1965, I too visited the Old Mission and State Historic Park of San Juan
Bautista while on a field trip from Fresno, California, and thereby, first
discovered my love of history and archaeology.
<P><B>Residents, Visitors, and Scholars</B>
<P>The Old Mission and State Historic Park has something for everyone.&nbsp;
From the casual visitor to the armchair historian, or college student and
scholar; the pristine setting, picturesque surroundings, Spanish colonial
and Mutsun Indian artifacts, and the host of Mexican and early American
buildings and furnishings all lend themselves to the historic atmosphere
to this early California community.&nbsp; Even today, a goodly number of
San Juan residents count themselves the descendants of the earliest Californians.&nbsp;
Whether you meet the oldest of San Juan residents on main street, or at
the helm of local businesses, or within the corridors of the Old Mission
and parish of San Juan, their historic surnames include Anzar, Larios,
Castro, Taix, Breen, Sayers, Vasquez, Zanetta, and a cast of hundreds of
early pioneer families and native descendants.&nbsp; This fact, and the
pristine setting of this old community all serve to enhance what many visitors
and residents have come to call the unique “spiritual” character of this
charming and timeless place where both history and community are one and
the same.
<CENTER>
<P><B>Chapter I: The Early History</B></CENTER>

<P>Long before the first Spanish and Mexican colonists and American settlers
entered the San Juan Valley, generations of Native American peoples lived
in the region.&nbsp; Over the years the discovery of ancient arrowheads,
spear points, shell beads, and human burials and animal bone, has provided
direct evidence that the ancestors of the Ohlone Mutsun and related peoples
first settled the San Benito area some 5,000 to 6,000 years before the
present. In those times, the region was quite lush, and the area immediately
below the Old Mission consisted of a vast flood plain and Tule marsh.&nbsp;
As such, wildlife was plentiful, and waterfowl were abundant.&nbsp; The
Ohlone Mutsun relied for food and shelter on the availability of riverine
and marsh-related resources, particularly Tule reed and waterfowl.&nbsp;
In addition, archaeology and history tell us that within the San Juan Valley
itself, the ancestors of the Ohlone Mutsun hunted Black-Tail Deer, Tule
Elk, Pronghorn Antelope, and a host of smaller creatures including the
Jack Rabbit.&nbsp; On the other hand, the “San Juaneros” so revered the
Grizzly Bear that they deified it in their myths and legends from the earliest
of times.
<P><B>The Ohlone Mutsun: Indian Life Before the Mission</B>
<P>The Mutsun constitute a regional branch of the larger Costanoan or Ohlone
culture of the Pacific Coast of North America.&nbsp; This larger grouping
of peoples inhabited the coastal and inland areas of that area extending
from Monterey Bay through to and including the San Francisco Bay area of
Central and Northern California.&nbsp; Their’s was a culture that was well
adapted to the coastal and inland resource areas of the region in question.&nbsp;
Because of the relatively abundant, though seasonal nature of both plant
and animal resources and foods in such a vast area, the Ohlone were, by
and large, a semi-nomadic peoples who maintained extensive village base
camps adjacent to rivers and streams, while opting for seasonal encampments
in the quest for other desired seasonal or region-specific resources.
<P>Though initial interpretations by early colonists painted a simple picture
of the native peoples, we now know the Ohlone Mutsun to have constituted
a relatively more complex society than heretofore acknowledged.&nbsp; Recent
archaeological discoveries, and linguistic and related studies, now indicate
the existence of extensive trading networks established and maintained
by the Ohlone Mutsun for the purpose of obtaining raw resources such as
obsidian glass and other important materials used in the production of
arrowheads and stone knives.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence for long distance
trade makes clear that the Ohlone Mutsun built up the necessary social,
cultural, linguistic, and political ties and relationships with other California
Native American peoples over the course of thousands of years of interactions
and engagements in carving a civilization from the wilderness.&nbsp; The
archaeological recovery of obsidian glass projectile points and arrowheads
from within and beyond the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista provides indications
of Ohlone Mutsun trade relations with areas as distant as that of the Great
Basin portions of northeastern and eastern California and Nevada.&nbsp;
From the present-day areas of Lassen and Modok counties, the Ohlone traded
for obsidian and other volcanic stone resources.&nbsp; From Native American
groups to the north and south, principally, other Ohlone and southern coastal
Chumash groups, the Ohlone Mutsun obtained shell ornaments, ear and nose
plugs, and related prestige items.
<P>While a number of studies have examined the sophistication and artistry
of the Ohlone and Mutsun Indian basketry technology and traditions, it
is clear that basketry and woven fiber clothing was but one of the many
unique innovations that permitted the Ohlone Mutsun to adapt to the unique
social and ecological landscapes of the region.&nbsp; Whether created for
domestic or utilitarian purposes (such as the processing of acorn seeds,
the serving of foods such as pozole or corn gruel, or the gathering of
water, wood, fuel or fiber), inter-Tribal and long-distance trade and prestige
relations and gift-giving, or used in Ohlone Mutsun ritual and ceremony
(such as that pertaining to the gathering and burning of sage and other
sacred offerings), Ohlone Mutsun basketry is a testament to the technological
ingenuity, innovation, and sophistication of a people with very deep roots
in the ancient California wilderness.
<P>When viewed in terms of its technology, Mutsun basketry was among the
most sophisticated of types produced in ancient California; when studied
in terms of art and design, it is clear that the artistic patterns, geometric
shapes, colors, and designs had a social and cultural meaning the translation
of which now eludes us.&nbsp; Fortunately, the language, myths and legends
of the Ohlone Mutsun people have survived to provide us a sense of the
spiritual and cultural life of “The People” prior to the arrival of the
Spanish missionaries in 1797.
<P>Community patterns and the settlements or “rancherias” of the Ohlone
Mutsun were often substantial settlements of several hundred people per
village.&nbsp; The accounts of the original founding of the Ohlone Mutsun
community that preceded the founding of the later community of San Juan
are now lost to history.&nbsp; However, we do know that upon reaching the
village that would eventually serve as the site of the founding of the
Old Mission of San Juan Bautista, “The People” referred to their community
as Popoluchem.
<P><B>The Early Spanish Entrada</B>
<P>On Friday, March 20, 1772, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Franciscan Father
Fray Juan Crespi, and Captain Commander Don Pedro Fages of the Royal Presidio
of San Carlos de Monterey set out on an expedition in search of an overland
route to the harbor of San Francisco.&nbsp; Twelve soldiers, including
six volunteers and six “Leather Jackets” or presidio soldiers, one muleteer,
and one “California Indian” pack mule driver began the journey on that
Friday of the second week of the Christian observance of Lent.&nbsp; A
student of the Presidente of the California mission system, Fray Junipero
Serra, Fray Crespi recorded his arrival in the San Juan Valley on Sunday,
March 22nd of 1772.&nbsp; At that time, Fray Crespi named the area San
Pascual Bailon -- a Catholic saint that continues to stand vigil at the
main altar of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.
<P>Having described the lush surroundings, and the presence of Oak trees
and Redwoods in the region, Fray Crespi also recounted having observed
antelope and the presence of bear tracks in the vicinity of the Rio San
Benito.&nbsp; Now known as San Juan Creek, Fray Crespi noted that the area
would provide adequate resources for settlement and colonization.&nbsp;
Upon his return to the Royal Presidio of Monterey, Fray Crespi’s report
later became the basis for the subsequent settlement of the Rio San Benito
under the direction of the then Father Presidente of the California mission
system, Fray Fermin Francisco de Lasuen of mission San Carlos Borromeo
del Rio Carmelo.
<P><B>The Founding of Old Mission San Juan</B>
<P>After the founding and dedication of Mission San Jose on the 11th of
June of 1797, Fray Fermin Lasuen -- in the company of a guard of Soldados
de Cuero or “Leather Jackets” under the leadership of Sargeant Pedro Amador
-- proceeded to the Rio San Benito.&nbsp; Upon arriving at the site of
the new mission, which by this time consisted of several makeshift adobe
and thatch buildings, Father Lasuen dedicated the mission of San Juan.
<P>On June 24th, 1797, the Father-Presidente of the California missions,
Fray Fermin Francisco de Lasuen of the mission of San Carlos de Borromeo,
dedicated the new mission of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Dedicated in the
name of Saint John the Baptist, whose feast day is that of June 24th, Father
Lasuen documented the grand event with the following accounting included
in the titlepage of the baptismal register:
<BR>&nbsp;
“First Book of Baptisms of Mission San Juan Bautista, Precursor
of Jesus Christ, founded at the expense of the Catholic King of Spain,
Carlos IV..., and by order of His Excellent Lord, the Marquis de Branciforte,
Viceroy of New Spain, on the spot called Popeloutchom by the natives, but
by our people, from the first discovery, San Benito, commenced on the very
day of the Titular Patron Saint, June 24th, 1797.&nbsp; On this day I,
the undersigned Presidente of the Missions of New California, entrusted
by his Majesty to the Apostolic College of the Propagation of the Faith
of San Fernando de Mexico, with the assistance of the Rev. Fathers and
Preachers Apostolic, Fr. Magin Catala and Fr. Joseph Manuel de Martiarena,
and with the aid of the troops destined to guard the establishment, in
the presence of many pagans from the surrounding country, who manifested
much pleasure, etc., I blessed water, the place and the great Cross, which
we planted and venerated.&nbsp; I immediately intoned the Litany of All
Saints, and sang High Mass during which I preached exhorting all to cooperate
for such a holy work.&nbsp; I concluded the function by solemnly singing
the Te Deum.&nbsp; May all be for the greater honor and glory of God, Our
Lord.&nbsp; Amen.”
<P>“Thus the place is now transformed into the Mission dedicated to the
Glorious Precursor of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Saint John, the Baptist,
on his very own day.&nbsp; Furthermore, by authority of the Apostolic College
of the Propagation of the Faith of San Fernando de Mexico, I named as its
first missionaries the Reverend Fathers Preachers Apostolic, Fr. Joseph
Manuel de Martiarena and Fr. Pedro Adriano Martinez.”</BLOCKQUOTE>

--- Fr. Fermin Francisco de Lasuen
<P>Established as the fifteenth of the twenty-one California missions,
San Juan was established at a time when Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen
was beset with the challenges of founding three California missions in
a single year.&nbsp; In that year, the missions of San Jose, San Juan,
and San Miguel were all founded.&nbsp; And so it was that the missions
of San Juan and San Miguel were built on the basis of a similar design
plan.&nbsp; In each, the main church lies at the north/northeast corner
of a quadrangle-enclosed courtyard complete with a long colonnade fronting
the main street or plaza.
<P><B>Sidebar: Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen</B>
<CENTER>
<P><B>Chapter II: The Growth of the Mission</B></CENTER>

<P>From their founding as among the few Spanish settlements north of Monterey,
San Juan Bautista and San Jose — both founded in 1797 — and the missions
of San Francisco de Asis (1776), Santa Cruz (1791), San Francisco Solano
(1823), literally served as the Northern Frontier of Spanish Christendom
until 1824.&nbsp; As an outpost along the El Camino Real or “King’s Road”
that linked the entire mission chain overland to Baja California, and by
extension to Mexico City, Old Mission San Juan Bautista was a welcome refuge
from the toil and travails of the rugged road that connected San Juan Bautista
to mission Santa Clara to the north, and the Royal Presidio of Monterey
to the south and west.
<P>Much of the early growth of Old Mission San Juan centered on the relatively
rapid construction of the original mission quadrangle and a series of early
church buildings and chapels.&nbsp; As one of the earliest chapels of San
Juan, the Chapel of 1799 provides a wonderful example of the nature and
layout of California Mission architecture at the end of the 18th Century
.&nbsp; Located immediately behind the main church, the chapel was originally
built to accommodate two doors leading into the chapel from the mission
courtyard on the one hand, and another two doors leading into the Campo
Santo or cemetery on the other.
<P>In its earliest period, mission records tell of the construction of
a series of temporary structures built of wattle and daub, grass, brush,
and adobe.&nbsp; The remains of one such building was recovered during
the excavation of the mission courtyard in 1995.&nbsp; A clay floor, posthole,
and artifacts included 18th and early 19th Century European porcelains
and a French “bale seal” or property tag made of copper.&nbsp; The tag
itself was perforated by a single hole, and was folded in two.&nbsp; On
the interior of the seal was depicted the profile and an inscription of
the name of French king Louis XVIII (circa 1804).
<P>In the founding year of the Old Mission, some twenty-eight Mutsun Indian
“rancherias” were located in and about the location selected as the site
of the mission of San Juan.&nbsp; The names of the these rancherias were
preserved by the missionaries in their registry or Libro de Registros.&nbsp;
Though many of the original rancherias survived the course of the mission
period, it was not uncommon for acculturated or “hispanicized” Mutsun peoples
to take up residence within adobe houses fronting the plaza or located
within the properties of the mission proper.&nbsp; The Mutsun rancherias
themselves typically consisted of tule reed structures arranged about forecourts
or open dance areas.&nbsp; Such structures were typically heated by rock-lined
hearths within or immediately outside the doors of each shelter.&nbsp;
Of the twenty-eight rancherias of that time, the site of Popeloutchom was
chosen as the site of the Old Mission and its attendant buildings.
<P>According to those documents that provide indications of the earliest
phase of construction at Old Mission San Juan, soldier and master mason
Jose Maria Franco -- who built the mill housing for a water-powered grist
mill at Mission Santa Cruz under Engineer Albert de Cordoba in the years
of 1797 and 1798 -- was dismissed from San Juan Bautista on May 7th of
1809.&nbsp; As such, it is likely that Franco was the master mason who
presided over the earliest construction of the Old Mission Church and Convento.&nbsp;
Archaeologist Glenn Farris found that a single room block or dormitory
within the former Neophyte Family Housing Area entailed the excavation
of two-hundred and forty five cubic yards of foundation trenching, the
laying of approximately the same volume in clay-laid siltstone foundations,
and the manufacture and laying of an estimated 34,000 standard sized --
22” x 11” x 4” -- adobe bricks.&nbsp; Clearly, the work of the master mason
was surely a gigantic task.
<BR>&nbsp;When all is said and done, the Old Mission Church -- with its
extended family and community of Native American and European parishioners
-- was the early focal point of the social, cultural and religious life
of San Juan Bautista and the San Benito Valley.&nbsp; The massive Church
and Convento wing that visitors tour on excursions to San Juan Bautista
are the sole surviving architectural remains of a once large and thriving
community of parishioners and early colonists.&nbsp; And so it is that
the Old Mission Church of San Juan continues to attract parishioners, pilgrims,
and tourists to its hallowed halls.&nbsp; In order to understand the place
and importance of the Old Church in the fabric of time, and by way of the
yarn of history, it should be noted that the mission church has undergone
many changes over the years...many of these changes themselves, however,
did not withstand the passage of time.&nbsp; The construction of the architectural
shell of the Old Mission Church spanned a period of some nine years of
continuous effort, and, was the inspiration of the design talents of Fathers
Domingo Santiago de Iturrate (1801-1809), Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta (1809-1812),
and the artistry of Father Esteban Tapis (1812-1825).
<P><B>The Old Mission Church</B>
<P>In an elaborate ceremony hosted on June 13th of 1803, Fathers Jose Manuel
de Martiarena and Domingo Iturrate, and a host of dignitaries, including
the then Governor ad interim of the Peninsula of Alta California -- Captain
General of the Dominion of New Spain Lieutenant-Colonel Don Jose Joaquin
de Arrillaga -- there took place the blessing and laying of the cornerstone
that served to initiate the immense construction project that resulted
in the creation of the largest of the California mission church buildings.&nbsp;
With the assistance of Fray Jose Viader of Mission Santa Clara, church
patron Don Jose de la Guerra y Noriega -- Ensign of the Cavalry at the
Presidio of Monterey, and Captain Don Jose Font and Surgeon Jose Umueta,
both of the Presidio of Monterey.&nbsp; At four in the afternoon, the assembled
soldiers and dignitaries prepared a commemorative offering that was deposited
into the hollow of the carved cornerstone of the main Church.&nbsp; According
to early documents of that day recounted by Fray Zephyrin Engelhardt, “In
the concavity of this first stone various silver coins of all denominations
were placed; and to their right a roll sealed with wax and within the paper
containing this description: Y para su constancia lo firmaron.&nbsp; Fr.
Jose Viader, Jose de la Guerra, Jose de Font, Juan de Dios Morelos, Jose
Umueta.”
<P>Though the cornerstone of the main Church was laid in 1803, the final
dedication ceremony would need to await the completion of the Church and
the feast day of St. John on June 23rd of 1812.&nbsp; Erected over a massive
-- five foot thick -- siltstone foundation, the church has endured two
centuries of relatively constant use and an occasional earthquake or two.&nbsp;
Though local lore speaks to the construction of a massive nine foot deep
foundation trench, the reality is that many of those foundation areas excavated
to date extend little deeper than three to six feet in depth.&nbsp; Ultimately,
the church’s foundations were reported completed in the annual Informe
of December 31st of 1804.&nbsp; By 1806, the padres reported the completion
or closure of the massive perimeter wall that once defined the quadrangle
that enclosed the mission couryard; whereas work on the mission cemetary
was begun in 1808 and many major features of the main church were completed
in 1809.&nbsp; And so it was that in 1809 the side-aisles of the mission
church were first mentioned, and in that year, completed.
<P><B>The Church Nave and Side Aisles</B>
<P>Interestingly, the side aisles and arcades adjoining the central nave
were not initially proposed as a feature of the original building plan
of the main church, and as such, they appear to have been an afterthought
added to the original plan by Fathers Domingo de Iturrate (1801-1809) and&nbsp;
Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta (1809-1812 and 1825-1833).&nbsp; Though the
original permit approved by the governor called for a church structure
measuring fifty-eight varas in length and ten varas in width (approximately
159.5’ x 27.5’ or 4,386.25 square feet), the addition of the side aisles
effectively doubled the width of the main church.
<P>The two arcades which serve to divide the main aisle of the Church from
the side aisles were well crafted and required a considerable expenditure
of time and resources.&nbsp; Each of the arcades were built from fired
tiles of the type exposed in some sections of the Convento arcade fronting
the main plaza.&nbsp; Each of the two arcades consist of six massive columns
and seven arches, for a total of fourteen arches and twelve columns.&nbsp;
And it is perhaps no coincidence that the number of columns and the number
of arches corresponds nicely with the twelve original apostles of Christ,
and the fourteen stations of the Cross.
<P>At some point shortly after the great earthquake of 1812, and in partial
response to the as yet relatively small size of the Mutsun Indian congregation,
the Franciscan Padres sealed the majority of the archways in the arcades
separating the side aisles from the central nave of the Church.&nbsp; At
that point, the side aisles were converted into rooms spanning the width
of&nbsp; each of the original archways.&nbsp; Though the two archways on
each side of the Church closest to the altar remained open so as to serve
as side-altars devoted to San Antonio and San Isidro, adobe walls served
to divide the side aisles on each side of the Church into approximately
four or five rooms each.&nbsp; At about that same time, one the arches
adjacent to the side-altar on the garden side of the Church was converted
for use as a stairway and platform for the placement of an ornate and colorful
wooden pulpit of Spanish colonial design; complete with a hymnal or book
stand sculpted in the form of a golden eagle.&nbsp; Whereas the rooms on
the courtyard or garden side of the Church were likely used as side altars,
study rooms, and storage areas, the rooms of the cemetery side of the Church
were used as burial areas and crypts during the period of the 1850’s.&nbsp;
Today, only two marble tombstones remain embedded within the floor of the
nave fronting the cemetary side of the main Church.&nbsp; The marble tombstones
mark the graves of one Don Ygnacio Rodriguez (“Natural de California,”
b. January 1, 1829, d. October 17, 1857) and that of Maria Antonia Castro
(d. May 30, 1855).&nbsp; According to an International News Photos press
release dated June 19, 1934, legend tells that “Maria Antonia Castro, daughter
of Gen. Castro who was provincial governor...is the original Rose of the
Rancho immortalized by Richard Walton Tully and dramatized by David Belasco.”
<P>It was not until the restoration efforts of the mid-1970’s that the
archways and side aisles were reopened and restored to their original pre-1812
appearance.&nbsp; Fans of producer and director Alfred Hitchcock’s movie
“Vertigo” will note that the sealed archways of the Old Mission Church
appear much as they did through the course of the 19th Century, and the
first half of the 20th Century.
<P>Though the foundations of the main Church were completed in 1804, the
walls of the Church itself were not erected until 1806. And while the three
naves of the Church were completed by 1809, the Church was not roofed until
1811.&nbsp; In that same year, the layout of the cemetary was completed.&nbsp;
By 1812, the Church was completed and dedicated, and an additional block
of rooms was attached to the dwellings of the missionaries which effectively
doubled the size of the Convento wing facing onto the main plaza.&nbsp;
Whereas that half of the Convento wing fronted by the arcade was completed
by about 1801, the expansion of 1812 effectively added an additional six
or seven rooms; the Old Mission Kitchen on that half of the Convento having
been reported “completed” as of 1810.&nbsp; It is that kitchen which can
today be seen from the courtyard arcade fronting the garden area.&nbsp;
At the time of the original construction, several rectangular and behive-shaped
hornos or ovens were installed for the baking of bread and related foods.&nbsp;
In addition to the expansion of the existing Convento wing, the older portion
of the Convento wing, including the sala or “Room of the Four Chimneys”
was reported renovated at this time.
<P>Many of the original features of the main Church, including the construction
and painting of the main altar reredos, the side altars originally dedicated
to San Antonio and San Isidro, the original paint of the walls and sacristy,
and the tiled floors were all completed between 1816 and 1818 under the
direction of Fray Esteban Tapis.&nbsp; Appropriately enough, it is Fray
Tapis whose ornate marble-covered burial crypt is located at the left side
of the main altar that he designed and constructed.
<P>Close inspection of the tiled portions of the main Church floor will
soon reveal to the observant visitor the tracks and paw prints of a variety
of animals, including mountain lions, cougars, dogs, and the ocassional
human.&nbsp; Because freshly molded floor and roof tiles, and adobe bricks,
were produced from moist clays laid out in the sun for drying and curing
just prior to being fired in large brick kilns, the old tiled floors of
the main Church remain a veritable chronicle of the wildlife that once
roamed freely about the Old Mission grounds.&nbsp; In the Old Mission Museum
are to be seen adobe bricks removed from the Chapel of 1799 that include
both Ohlone Mutsun footprints and the paw prints of the indomitable mountain
lion; and so it is that one can easily imagine the many animal tracks and
human foot and hand prints that lie buried in the adobe walls and tiled
floors of Old Mission San Juan.
<P><B>The Main Altar</B>
<P>As has so often been the case in the history of San Juan Bautista, the
Old Mission has proven itself a haven for lost souls and a refuge from
the ills that beset many of that time.&nbsp; In this instance, a runaway
American sailor by the name of Thomas Doak -- who deserted the American
merchant ship named the “Albatrosss” -- sought and found refuge at the
Old Mission.&nbsp; In 1816, Thomas Doak jumped ship along with a fellow
sailor named Bob (a.k.a. Juan Cristobal) at the Puerto de Monterey and
trekked inland along what was then a major thoroughfare to the north --
El Camino Real or the “King’s Road.” Doak eventually reached the community
of San Juan Bautista, the Old Mission of which was literally perched above
the only surviving intact portion of the El Camino Real that remains in
California.&nbsp; It was there that Thomas Doak struck a deal with Franciscan
Father Fray Estevan Tapis, who at that moment found himself hardpressed
to come up with the six reales per day required to contract a Monterey-based
painter by the name of Jose Mateo de la Luz Chaves who was to have painted
the main altar designed by Fray Tapis within the sanctuary of the newly
completed church.&nbsp; Completed in 1812, the main church remained without
the altar screen needed to accommodate the newly acquired 1817 era “santos”
or saints that would eventually come to grace the “nichos” or niches of
the completed altar screen.&nbsp; In exchange for room and board, Thomas
Doak -- who was eventually baptized under the Christian name of Felipe
Santiago and married Lugarda Castro, the daughter of Don Mariano Castro
-- completed the painting of the main altar (designed by Fray Estevan Tapis)
during the course of the year of 1818.&nbsp; According to Doak, he crafted
the altar screen “with the help of some muchachos.”&nbsp; Casual inspection
of the “reredos” or main altar screen has led some to conclude that it
was fashioned after the appearance of the stern end of the great whaling
ships of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries.
<P>Though we are left with the impression that Monterey resident and painter
Jose Mateo de la Luz Chaves, originally of Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico,
was not contracted to paint the main altar because of his request for the
payment of six reales per day; art historian Norman Neuerburg contends
that Chaves may well have been the artist who completed the painting of
the side altars of the main Church in 1816.&nbsp; Chaves is also credited
by Neuerburg as the artist who very likely completed several other murals
of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.
<P>The main altar is composed of six nichos or niches for the placement
of the sculpted santos.&nbsp; Today, the main altar reredos contains the
sculpted statues of San Antonio de Padua (St. Anthony, A.D. 1195-1231),
San Domingo (St. Dominic, A.D. 1170-1221), San Francisco de Asis (St. Francis,
A.D. 1181-1226), San Isidro (St. Isadore, A.D. 1070-1130), San Juan Bautista
(St. John the Baptist, June 24th and August 29th, First Century A.D.),
and San Pascual Bailon (St. Paschal Baylon, A.D. 1540-1592).&nbsp; Whereas
San Antonio (upper left) is thought of as the Patron of the Poor and of
lost objects, San Francisco (upper right) was the founder of the Franciscan
order under which San Juan was founded.&nbsp; San Pascual Bailon (lower
right) is in turn the saint identified with the virtues of kindness to
all creatures, particularly those under the care of any goodly shepherd.&nbsp;
San Isidoro (lower left) is the patron of the agricultural laborer, and
hence the agricultural tool that he wields; whereas, Santo Domingo (upper
center) was the founder of the Dominican order.&nbsp; Visitors to the mission
often confuse the life-sized central image in the lower tier of the altar
with that of Jesus Christ; while in fact, the image is that of San Juan
Bautista or St. John the Baptist with the Pascal lamb that symbolizes Jesus.&nbsp;
It is for St. John, the namesake of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista,
that this mission has been called the “Precursor’s mission,” as St. John’s
ministry preceded the immaculate conception of Jesus Christ.
<P>Fray Roman Fernandez de Ullibarri made note of the fact that on June
3rd of 1809, the statue of San Juan Bautista “was erected on the main altar
of the sacristy that is serving as the Church.”&nbsp; Prior to the placement
of the image of St. John the Baptist on the main altar completed by Thomas
Doak in 1818, it stood vigil over the temporary church that was the sacristy
for some nine years prior to its placement in the main altar where it currently
holds a prominent place at the center of the altar screen.&nbsp; Though
we are unclear as to whether the sacristy area of that time is the same
as that of the existing sacristy, or with that area now identified with
the Chapel of 1799; it may well be that the colonial era&nbsp; statue of
Saint John was placed in the Chapel of 1799 along the northwest wall.&nbsp;
In that location are the remains of two hewn timbers that once projected
from a wall where the original altar screen may have been located.
<P>After the great earthquake of 1906, the santos of the main altar were
removed to one of the rooms of the Convento wing (or Chapel of 1799) located
just outside of the main church.&nbsp; At that time, the parish and community
of San Juan was in the midst of recovering from the devastation of the
day.&nbsp; Because of fears that aftershocks and the collapse of the side
aisles might have weakened the fabric of the main church, Father Closa
diverted services to the Convento wing and other areas of the Old Mission.&nbsp;
In photos dated to the period immediately after the great earthquake of
1906, the santos are pictured standing along the walls of either the Old
Convento or Chapel areas.&nbsp; Among the photos is one that pictures San
Antonio with the silver halo that disappeared from the mission shortly
after that time.&nbsp; Today, each of the santos has been returned to their
original locations within the altar screen of the main Church.
<P><B>Sidebar: The Mission of Music and the Legacy of Father Tapis</B>
<P>Of the six Franciscans (1797-1854), and twenty-one Pastors (1854-1998),
that have served the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista as of this writing,
the Reverend Esteban Tapis (1812-1825) is the personality that contributed
most directly to San Juan’s identity as the “Mission of Music.”&nbsp; It
was Father Estevan Tapis who, in 1812 arrived at the Old Mission and soon
crafted the color-coded music hymnals or alabados used by the Ohlone Mutsun
of that time.&nbsp; The hymnals, which can still be seen in the Old Mission
museum, were crafted by hand and were rendered in both Latin and Spanish.&nbsp;
Many of the spiritual hymns recorded therein are those that made up the
core of the early California Roman Catholic musical tradition.
<P>Father Tapis, who was buried under the main altar of the Old Mission
Church in 1825, spent his days teaching the gospel through music and native
dialects, while at the same time, serving as the architect of the main
altar reredos and a number of the Old Mission’s more distinctive architectural
and artistic characteristics.&nbsp; Fray Estevan Tapis was born in the
Villa de Santa Colona de Farnes in the Diocese of Gerona within the Province
of Cataluna, Spain, and spent forty-eight of his sixty-nine years as a
Franciscan, and thirty-eight of those years in Alta California.&nbsp; During
Father Tapis’ tenure at Old Mission San Juan, he oversaw a number of major
construction projects critical to the completion of the Old Mission and
its outlying buildings and compounds.&nbsp; In addition to designing and
supervising the construction of the altar screen of the main Church in
1816, Fray Tapis also oversaw the design and construction of two side altars,
including one for San Antonio de Padua and another for San Isidro in that
same year.
<P>From the first year of his ministry at San Juan to his death on November
3rd of 1825, Fray Tapis oversaw several sizeable construction and renovation
projects, including the dedication of the main Church (over which he presided
as then Father Presidente of the California mission chain), the renovation
and expansion of the existing Convento wing, the construction of much of
that area identified with Neophyte family housing, a lime kiln for firing
tiles and bricks, a fulling mill for the processing of wool, the construction
of adobe corrals for horses and sheep, and the reroofing and reflooring
of the granary, kiln, weaving rooms, and barracks buildings.&nbsp; Moreover,
through the thirteen years of his ministry at San Juan, Fray Tapis commissioned
or supervised the construction of more than seventy individual houses for
Mutsun Indian converts, in addition to the construction of a large (20
x 6 varas) dormitory for Mutsun widowers and single men in 1815; and this
in addition to his contributions toward the building of a solid agricultural
base for the mission community and providing for the spiritual needs of
the parish.
<P>Shortly after his death, Fray Luis Gil recorded the following statement
regarding the burial of Fray Tapis in the burial registry of 1825:
“On November 4, 1825, I gave ecclesiastical burial in the sanctuary
near the Gospel-side of the church of this Mission of San Juan Bautista
to the body of the Rev. Fr. Estevan Tapis, Emeritus, and Ex-Presidente
for many years of these Missions of New and Alta California.&nbsp; He had
been missionary at San Carlos, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz,
San Luis Rey, Santa Ines, and Purisima Concepcion, while Fr. Presidente,
and finally at San Juan Bautista...In consequence he was much beloved by
the Religious, the military, the settlers and the Indians.&nbsp; He preached
continually with fervor.&nbsp; When he could he would teach the boys the
rudiments of ordinary schooling; he would write the music for the singers
in the church, by which means he endeavored to elevate the festivities
and solemnities not only among the Indians, but also among all others.&nbsp;
In this way he would see that they made their confessions on the major
feasts.&nbsp; In truth Fr. Tapis exercised his apostolic ministry to edify
all.&nbsp; Hence it is that he was blameless Religious, worthy of the highest
praise, and honor to this territory, and particularly to the College of
San Fernando de Mexico, to which he turned annually soliciting Religious
to come and labor in this vineyard of the Lord.”</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the final hours of his life, Fray Tapis was accompanied by a number
of his closest friends and colleagues, including Fray Felipe Arroyo de
la Cuesta from whom he received the Holy Unction or final blessing, Fray
Vicente Francisco de Sarria of San Juan, Fray Jose Viader of Mission Santa
Clara, Fray Buenaventura Fortuni of Mission San Jose, and Fray Luis Gil.
<P><B>The Baptistery</B>
<P>In addition to the carved wood and paint and gesso-coated santos of
the main altar reredos, the baptismal font to the south or left side of
the main entrance to the church is original to the mission construction
of 1812.&nbsp; Within and just outside the door of the baptistery are paintings
of St. John the Baptist included in the December of 1820 Informes inventory
of items acquired for the church by Fathers Estevan Tapis and Felipe Arroyo
de la Cuesta.&nbsp; Within the interior of the baptistery are included
the original hand-sculpted baptismal fonts carved by the early Mutsun sculptors
of San Juan.&nbsp; Carved in native sandstone, the two fonts are sculpted
in the style of those to be found in many a north Mexican church and mission
and consist of two massive barrel-like sandstone basins.&nbsp; In this
ancient baptistery were baptized the several thousand native Mutsun and
early European colonists, residents, and parishioners who served, lived
and worked within the old community of San Juan Bautista and the ranchos
and rancherias of&nbsp; the San Benito Valley.
<P>In the Spring of 1997, as but one of the many events planned for the
bicentennial celebrations of the founding of Old Mission San Juan Bautista,
parishioners undertook a group tour and pilgrimatge of those sites in Spain
identified with the lives of Fathers Junipero Serra and Fermin Francisco
de Lasuen.&nbsp; As the result of a visit to the community of Father Fermin
Lasuen’s birth, the community of Extremadura (?) held a special mass and
ceremony for the visiting parishioners of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp;
At that ceremony, the Spanish parish priest of the church where Father
Lasuen was baptized in 1730 (?) donated a copy of Father Lasuen’s 18th
Century baptismal certificate to the parish of San Juan Bautista as a tribute
to the Old Mission and community founded by Father Lasuen.&nbsp; Today,
Lasuen’s baptismal certificate holds an honored place on the right-hand
wall of the interior of the baptistery room of Old Mission San Juan Buatista.
<P><B>Sidebar: The Stations of the Cross and the Paintings of the Apostles,
ca. 1818</B>
<P>According to Reverend Zephyrin Engelhardt, “The church was enriched
with canvas pictures of the Via Crucis, and the main altar was built of
planed boards” in the year of 1818.&nbsp; The paintings depicting the Via
Crucis, or the fourteen “Stations of the Cross” and the Passion of Christ,
are among the most important furnishings of any of the Old California Catholic
missions.&nbsp; And the paintings of San Juan Bautista are among the finest
such Colonial period representations of the Via Cruces and the sufferings
of Jesus Christ leading up to and including his arrest by Roman soldiers,
his trial and persecution, and the trek that would lead the Savior to the
summit of Golgada or the “Hill of Skulls,” where he was ultimately crucified.
<P>In the case of the Via Crucis of Old Mission San Juan, the paintings
are intended to provide the pilgrim with a pictorial narrative of the events
leading up to the crucifiction of Christ.&nbsp; The paintings are each
numbered with Roman numerals (painted in dark red paint) and each painting
is currently positioned so as to allow the viewer to begin with the first
of the paintings nearest the altar -- positioned on the column immediately
to the right of the main altar or cemetary side of the Church.&nbsp; Proceeding
from the area nearest the altar, the visitor may view the first six of
the paintings depicting the Passion of Christ on the arcade to the left
-- each occupies the upper portion of&nbsp; one of each of the six columns
on the northeast or cemetary side of the Church -- and proceed to the back
or entrance area of the Church where the seventh and eighth Stations are
located.&nbsp; The last six paintings, depicting the Via Dolorosa or path
to the Hill of Skulls, continue from the column situated closest to the
baptistery on the left side of the Church, and end with the last station
on the column closest to the main altar on the left or garden side of the
Church.&nbsp; The final painting depicts the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
Like the large paintings of the Apostles that grace the walls of each of
the side aisles, the paintings of the Via Crucis retain their original
handcarved Mexican wood frames and bear the traces of two hundred years
of exposure to the elements and the smoke of burning votive candles.
<P>In addition to the richly-rendered canvases of the Via Crucis, the Old
Mission Church and Chapel contain many other paintings of the saints and
related images of importance to the Catholic church.&nbsp; Among the paintings
contained in the side-aisles of the Church are included a number of large
paintings of the Apostles.
<P>Finally, within the side-altar (devoted to the Santo Nino de Atocha
or Christ Child) on the right or cemetary-side of the Church are to be
found three unusual paintings.&nbsp; These include a painting of the Nativity
or birth of Christ, hung within the arcade archway closest to altar on
the right side of the Church.&nbsp; According to local lore, and personal
observation, when viewed from different angles and under varying lighting
conditions, the painting appears to change.&nbsp; Whereas the clouds above
the manger appear to form an image of the martyred Christ, the robes of
the people depicted -- and the animals illustrated therein -- appear to
take on the form of various creatures ranging from the face of a bear,
to that of an owl and a mountain lion...all animals original to local Mutsun
Indian lore and legend.
<P>The second painting is that of the martyred and bloodied Christ laid
atop the cornice on the right side-altar.&nbsp; The painting, which is
likely of late 19th Century origin, hung within the Old Mission Museum
for a number of years; and is depicted in early photographs as having once
graced the side-altar in question.&nbsp; The last painting from the area
above the side-altar is that of a Colonial era depiction of Joseph holding
the infant Jesus.&nbsp; The painting is quite delicately done and follows
the style of the Mexican-origin religious paintings to be found throughout
the main Church.
<P>Among the large paintings hung on the walls of the nave on the cemetary
side of the Church are those of San Mateo (St. Matthew), San Juan (St.
John), San Simon (St. Simon), San Bartolo (St. Bartholemew), San Thadeo
(St. Thadeus), St. James the Great, and San Miguel Arcangel (St. Michael
the Archangel).&nbsp; The painting of San Miguel is filled with images
of angels, doves, and the heavens, and is rendered in the classic style
of the 18th Century artists of Colonial-era Mexico or New Spain.&nbsp;
On the walls of the area adjacent the main entrance, and immediately adjacent
to the doorway leading to the ancient choir loft, is a painting of the
Virgin Mary.&nbsp; Below her image are the words, “mater dolorosa pronoris”
-- Latin for -------------------------.
<P>To the left side of the main entrance, within the Baptistery, is hung
a large painting of Jesus kneeling before St. John the Baptist.&nbsp; Just
outside the door of the Baptistery is another such painting of what appears
to be St. John, however, the painting depicts words emanating from the
mouth of the saint.&nbsp; Among those words that remain visible is that
of the name of San Ignacio Loyola.&nbsp; In this instance, the painting
no longer retains its original wooden frame, and appears to have been cut
from a larger image.
<P>On the wall adjacent the Baptistery is another side altar which bears
a very large and bloodied image of the Crucified Christ.&nbsp; Given that
two other similar, but much smaller, Mexican-origin crucifix are dated
to the mid- to late 18th Century, it is likely that the crucifix on this
side altar dates to that period as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the renovations
of the mid-1970’s, the present location this side-altar was occupied by
a massive adobe staircase to the choir loft built some time after 1825.
<P>Hung within the nave on the garden side of the Church are the large
paintings of San Pablo (St. Paul), San Pedro (St. Peter), San Andreas (St.
Andrew), St. James the Less, San Felipe (St. Phillip), St. Mathias, and
Santo Tomas (St. Thomas).&nbsp; Located on the wall adjacent the side-altar
devoted to Nuestra Senora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows) is an unframed
painting of San Francisco de Asis bearing an open book or hymnal.&nbsp;
Within the arcade of the archway closest to the left side of the main altar
is a painting of San Francisco seated adjacent a cave with one foot perched
atop a human skull.&nbsp; The skull serving as a symbol of the martyrdom
of Christ on the Hill of Skulls, whereas the open cave or crypt symbolizes
the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
<P>Taken together, San Juan’s collection of Colonial period paintings represents
one of the artistic treasures of the California mission chain.&nbsp; In
addition to the artistic merit and preservation of these original works,
it is important to note that these paintings are original to the Old Mission
of San Juan Bautista, and a number of these paintings are documented from
various archival sources as having been brought to the mission in the period
before 1820.&nbsp; Among others, Fray Engelhardt has documented that two
of the larger paintings -- specifically, those of San Miguel, the Archangel,
and San Francisco de Asis -- were obtained in 1816 by way of the Port of
Monterey.&nbsp; The majority of the paintings of the Apostles, including
St. Mathias and St. John the Baptist, were obtained in 1820.
<P><B>Sidebar: The “Cat” Door</B>
<P>The so-called “Cat Door” of the Old Mission Church has long held the
interest of the many visitors to this most historic of California missions.&nbsp;
The door in question may be seen at the foot of the southeast door leading
from the courtyard portico and museum area into the main Church.&nbsp;
Though a number of the old photographs that grace the mission archives
room depict the doorway, few provide any direct indication of when the
“Cat Door” was carved at the base of the old redwood door leading into
the church side-aisle.&nbsp; The door itself measures about nine inches
wide by twelve inches in height.&nbsp; According to local lore, the “Cat
Door” was carved for the many cats that were maintained on the mission
grounds as a form of “pest control.”&nbsp; In the days before pest control
companies made available insecticides and rodent traps, the missionaries
were left to fend for themselves.&nbsp; Because the Old Mission is perched
above an agricultural field and former mission orchard, the presence of
field mice and other wild creatures was clearly a problem for the Old Mission
and its parish community.&nbsp; The cats, of course, made themselves indispensable
by virtue of keeping the rodents at a safe distance.&nbsp; The “Cat Door”
insured that the main Church remained free of the pesky rodents.
<P><B>The Old Mission Cemetery</B>
<P>Located just outside the northeast wall of the Old Mission Church lies
the original “Campo Santo” or mission era cemetery.&nbsp; Perched at the
edge of the great San Andreas Fault, the Old Mission Cemetery is said to
contain the remains of some 4300 Mutsun people and early European colonists.&nbsp;
At first glance, the visitor is hardpressed to imagine how it was possible
to inter so many people in so small an area.&nbsp; According to popular
accounts and legends, the Indians were rolled into blankets and buried
one atop the other, and by this means it was possible to accommodate so
many of the dead.&nbsp; Another implication of such myths and legends is
that the Indians were stacked in mass burials as a result of great plagues
and epidemics that swept the missions.&nbsp; Any careful examination of
the missions Informes or yearly reports rarely reports more than an average
of approximately eighty deaths per one thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; Though
16 native deaths were reported in the first two years of the missions existence,
from 1797 through 1798, the arrival of 45 native settlers from San Carlos
increased the population of the mission to a total of 21l.&nbsp; In the
third year of San Juan’s existence, no Native American or other deaths
were reported in the Informe of December 1800.&nbsp; However, in the two
year period from January 1st of 1805 until December 31st of 1806, three
hundred and seven deaths were reported over that two year period by Fray
Domingo de Hurrate and Fray Andres Dulanto.&nbsp; Despite the losses, the
1805 census totals 1112 inhabitants, whereas the 1806 census lists a total
population of 1068.&nbsp; In addition to those initial years of the founding
of the mission when no Native Americans are counted among the dead, the
report of December 1817 notes that of a population of 608, some 35 Native
Americans succumbed.&nbsp; Two years later, the native population stood
at 843, and the number of deaths reported stood at 37, with one of those
deaths being that of a European or Spaniard.&nbsp; In 1824, the year that
Mexico achieved independence from Spain, the native population stood at
1,221, while the number of native dead increased to 116.&nbsp; In 1832,
on the eve of the Mexican secularization of the California missions, Fray
Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta and Fray Juan Moreno reported a total of 73
deaths of a population of 916.&nbsp; And finally, in the final year during
which reports were filed by the Franciscans of Old Mission San Juan Bautista,
of a total “mission” population of 992, Native American deaths accounted
for 42 of the total 54 deaths for the year of 1840.&nbsp; In sum, the mission
padres buried some 3,268 native Mutsun and European colonists in the period
from 1799 -- a number that falls well below the projected total “mission”
era death toll.
<P>The cemetery, which contains the burials of several thousand, was in
fact partitioned into two separate burial areas.&nbsp; The area adjacent
to the main church was highly desired as a place of burial as this was
the ground that was blessed by the Bishop of Monterey at its dedication
in the early 1800’s.&nbsp; This was the Campo Santo, or only officially
blessed parcel of “holy ground” available to the mission community of San
Juan.&nbsp; As was the custom of the day, Christians sought burial in grounds
that had been officially blessed because these were the only acknowledged
route to heaven and full-fledged redemption in the kingdom of God.&nbsp;
As a result, the Campo Santo was in much demand by the families of the
deceased.
<P>In the 1850’s (?), Manuel Larios (?) donated a sizeable parcel of land
to the community of San Juan Bautista for the purposes of creating a new
cemetary.&nbsp; The Larios family, one of the earliest of Californio families,
maintained a private area within the new cemetary for Larios family members.&nbsp;
Visitors to Cemetary Hill will note tombstones of both wood and stone that
date to the early 1850’s.&nbsp; Among these are included the marble headstones
and elaborate monuments of the Breen family whose ancestors were among
the survivors of the Donner Party tragedy of the 1840’s.
<P><B>The Chapel of 1799</B>
<P>One of the earliest of the three churches constructed on the site of
Old Mission San Juan Bautista is that of the Chapel of 1799.&nbsp; This
chapel, which stands immediately behind the principal altar of the main
Church, can be accessed by way of a ramp leading from the Old Mission Garden
into the chapel itself.&nbsp; Though the chapel now boasts a single entry
door and window facing on the garden, and a similar window and door combination
leading into the cemetery, the chapel was originally accessed by way of
two doors on both the south (or courtyard and garden area) and north (cemetery
area) sides of the mission chapel.&nbsp; In its earliest days, the Mutsun
people were the principal parishioners.&nbsp; On those days when church
services were filled to capacity, it is said that the men and women would
stand in the area of the four doorways that once led into the chapel.&nbsp;
With the construction of the main church, the Chapel of 1799 took on a
secondary role and was largely relegated to the status of a storage area
and community hall.
<P>Over the years, the Chapel of 1799 saw many uses and performed a host
of functions, many of which are still talked about by some of those older
residents of San Juan who remember attending events in the former church
when it served as a community hall, and later, as a basketball court and
thrift shop.&nbsp; In the end, an attempt was made in the 1970’s to turn
the former chapel into a museum area so as to accommodate a large sixteen
by sixteen foot scale model of Old Mission San Juan Bautista created by
the inmates of the Atascadero State Mental Hospital.
<P>Prior to the restoration of the Chapel of 1799, it was first necessary
to relocate the Mission Model as it occupied a good part of the back portion
of the chapel.&nbsp; In January 1996, student volunteers from the CSU Monterey
Bay Institute of Archaeology dismantled the mission model, removed the
countless bolts holding the massive model together, and carted the model
out of the room in five major sections.&nbsp; The model, which includes
a fired tile roof made from clay mined from the mission grounds, weighs
hundreds, if not thousands of pounds, and on the day it was moved by the
archaeology students, the pieces were carried by hand down 2nd Street to
the front arcade of the mission and into the Old Mission Museum where the
model remains to this day.
<P>Having removed the mission model, efforts quickly shifted to the renovation
of the wooden floors of the old chapel and the removal of a restroom facility
and dressing room that had been constructed in the second archway leading
to the original vestments room or sacristy of the main church.&nbsp; Having
reopened and removed a considerable amount of trash and debris, antiquated
additions to the chapel, such as a gas ceiling furnace and many exposed
electrical cables were removed and new lighting installed.&nbsp; The two
wooden chandeliers, placed in the chapel during the 1930’s era renovations
of the church, were repaired and rewired by Sir Richard Menn.&nbsp; Soon
thereafter, a painter was contracted to repaint the interior of the chapel.&nbsp;
Because the renovations of the archways exposed original paintings on the
southeast corner of the chapel’s lower wall section, it was decided that
the original colonial era murals would be recreated throughout the chapel,
and as such, the chapel was returned to its original colonial-era appearance.
<P><B>Sidebar: Tallow Candles and Mutsun Footprints</B>
<P>During the 1996 restoration of the Chapel of 1799, workmen reopened
a sealed archway that once connected the Chapel to the sacristy room adjacent
the Old Mission cemetery to the north.&nbsp; During the course of removing
the adobe bricks placed in the archway in about 1812, it soon became clear
that a number of the old adobes were inscribed with artwork in the form
of geometric “basketry-like” patterns and both human and animal footprints
including the paw prints of a mountain lion.&nbsp; The footprints themselves
were probably those of the Mutsun men and women who produced the adobes
themselves.&nbsp; At the very top of the archway, the removal of the first
few adobes revealed a cache of some fourteen tallow candles apparently
placed as an offering or as the result of the blessing of the work in question.
<P>Once the work of restoring the chapel was completed, the Chapel of 1799,
or the Capilla de Guadalupe and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, were
blessed by the Bishop of Monterey and Father Ed Fitz-Henry in a service
that was accompanied by music, song, and the reading of the scriptures.&nbsp;
The dedication of the restored chapel took place on June 24th, 1997, the
official day of the Old Mission’s bicentennial celebration.&nbsp; The altar
under which the service was held, and which now stands at the center of
the Chapel of 1799, is the very same altar under which Pope John Paul II
was seated during his visit to the mission of San Carlos de Borromeo in
1987.&nbsp; The altar, which was meticulously restored by the curator of
the Diocese of Monterey, Sir Richard Menn of San Carlos or Carmel, was
brought from Spain and dates to 1565.&nbsp; Today, the Chapel of 1799 has
been returned to the service of the parish community in the form of the
Capilla or Chapel of Guadalupe and the Holy Sacrament, and provides the
location for weekday services and special ceremonies.
<P><B>The Old Mission Courtyard</B>
<P>The courtyard and its garden, located at the heart of the former mission
quadrangle, was once the center of mission industry.&nbsp; In addition
to lying adjacent to the chapel, main church, convento, and mission kitchen
-- which are the only surviving remains of the original mission quadrangle
-- the courtyard was flanked on the southwest by a long-narrow range structure
much like that of the existing convento wing.&nbsp; The southwest convento
was in its earliest days a clay-floored, tile-roofed, adobe structure which
fell into ruin some time after the 1830’s.&nbsp; Given the layout and functions
of many an early California mission settlement, it is likely that the southwest
convento wing served as a storage and workshop area, while the courtyard
itself served as an extended work and garden area.&nbsp; In its heyday,
the courtyard was the center for a variety of activities ranging from the
preparation of tallow candles to the tanning of leather; carpentry, metal
manufactory and related activities conducted in the former rooms of the
mission’s workshop area.&nbsp; Because the missions were by necessity self
sufficient, many of the tools and furnishings of the missions were crafted
on site, and so it was that Franciscan padres, Mission Indian and itinerant
Spanish and Mexican Indian craftsman invested themselves in the work of
preparing tools, creating implements, crafting furnishings, and erecting
new adobe rooms.
<P>At the center of the mission courtyard is located the Old Mission Well.&nbsp;
Though no known record provides an indication of when the well was constructed;
the presence of trash dating from the 1870’s through 1920’s suggests that
the well was used as a water source prior to the 1870’s.&nbsp; In the Fall
of 1995, the Old Mission well was exposed and excavated by Institute of
Archaeology of the California State University Monterey Bay.&nbsp; In an
effort to restore the upper portion of the old well, volunteers from the
Gabilan Conservation Camp and the university joined forces in an effort
to excavate and rebuild the mouth of the ancient well.&nbsp; Excavations
within the well produced Spanish period canon balls, 19th Century bottle
and porcelain fragments, mission roof and floor tiles, copper and wrought
iron metal work, and a variety of shell and stone artifacts.
<P>In 1825, visitors within the courtyard would have been able to walk
the circuit of the courtyard along the walls of the Convento, and workshop
and storage areas along a tile-covered and adobe-floored arcade.&nbsp;
Though the only surviving structures that originally fronted the courtyard
are those today identified with the Chapel, main church, and existing Convento,
the Southwest and Northwest Convento Wings served to complete the enclosure.&nbsp;
These in turn were fronted by an arcade consisting of redwood posts or
pedestals, and a wood-framed tile roof.&nbsp; Though the original arcade
of the Convento Wing has since been modified into one consisting of massive
masonry columns with wooden lintels or vigas, the original redwood columns
were still visible on the courtyard arcade until the restoration efforts
of the 1970’s.
<CENTER>
<P><B>&nbsp;Chapter III: The Old Plaza and State Park</B></CENTER>

<P>Just as the Courtyard served as the focal point of the religious community
of Old Mission San Juan, the Old Plaza fronting the mission necessarily
served as the epicenter of much of the buildout of the social and political
life of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did the plaza serve as
the staging area for many community events and festivals, during much of
the 19th Century, the plaza was used as the arena for bull fights, games,
rodeos, and the infamous bull or mountain lion versus grizzly bear fights.&nbsp;
In those days, a grizzly bear was teathered to a post at the center of
the plaza and either bulls or mountain lions were set against the giant
grizzlies of the day.&nbsp; Today, the grizzlies are gone, but the plaza
remains a focal point for living history days and many related community
activities.
<P>On September 9th of 1935 the San Juan Bautista State Historic Park was
officially dedicated.&nbsp; According to Charles Clough, beginning in March
of 1928 the State Park Commission began its efforts to identify locations
from throughout the state of California that might make suitable “playgrounds.”&nbsp;
With the coming of the Great Depression, the process of purchasing the
plaza and surrounding buildings heralded the promise and benefits of tourism
for a community hard hit by the ills of that time.&nbsp; Father Francis
McCaffrey and the parish of San Juan Bautista ultimately ceded the lands
immediately in front of the mission to the city via the San Juan Plaza
Preservation League for the purposes of creating the State Park.&nbsp;
The historic buildings fronting the plaza were in turn sold to the state,
at great discount, by the previous owners; including, Mrs. Fred Beck (Plaza
Hotel), the Breen family (Castro Adobe), and Constable Zanetta and Miss
Victoria Zanetta (Zanetta home and stables).
<P>Since September 9th of 1935, the state has maintained the lands immediately
in front of the Old Mission as a historic district.&nbsp; The Old Plaza
itself is surrounded by such historic structures as the Plaza Hotel, the
Castro-Breen Adobe, the Livery Stables, the Zanetta House and Plaza Hall,
and the Vicky Cottage.&nbsp; In addition, the Taix Lot, formerly the property
of prosperous San Juan businessman Mr. Antoine Taix, was ceded to the state
and currently serves as an equipment storage area for the state park.&nbsp;
Beneath the Taix Lot lie the foundations and remains of the former Neophyte
Family Housing area that once housed the Hispanicized Ohlone-Mutsun Indian
converts of the period after 1824.
<P>So as to provide a glimpse into the original relationships had between
the buildings of the plaza and the Old Mission proper, the following summary
of the original buildings identifies the original Colonial period buildings
and their 19th Century counterparts.
<P><B>El Cuartel</B>
<P>The “cuartel” or military barracks buildings constructed to accommodate
the Soldados de Cuero or “Leather Jackets” and other military personnel
(originally stationed at Monterey) was constructed in the years of 1813
and 1814.&nbsp; In fact, the present location of the Plaza Hotel which
lies immediately to the south of the old mission on the main plaza, was
the original site of the Spanish period cuartel or barracks structure.&nbsp;
In its earliest phase the cuartel consisted of a one floor adobe with a
large two storied tower at the buildings east end.&nbsp; On September 20th
of 1847, American surveyor and engineer W. R. Hutton created a hand rendered
illustration of the plaza showing the ruined nunnery to the far left, the
Castro Adobe to the left of center, and the cuartel or barracks building
to the top of center.&nbsp; The old mission is depicted to the right complete
with the old wooden cross originally erected when the mission was founded.&nbsp;
In this instance, the cuartel is depicted as one story structure with two
doors and two windows on the barracks side of the building, and two first
floor doors and one second story window in the tower area adjacent a wall
connecting the Castro Adobe to the barracks tower.
<P><B>El Monjerio</B>
<P>According to historian Ralph Milliken, a nunnery or monjerio for single
or unmarried women was erected directly across the plaza in 1815, and was,
subsequently, extended in size in 1832.&nbsp; The home of General Mariano
Castro was constructed in 1840 and 1841.&nbsp; The Zanetta house, which
came to occupy the former location of the nunnery, and was in fact constructed
from the salvaged adobes of the former nunnery, was converted into the
family home by Angelo Zanetta during the 1860’s.&nbsp; In one early view
of San Juan’s main plaza, Henry Miller depicted the plaza from the vantage
point of the former “Neophyte Family Housing Area” which lies behind the
Plaza Stables in a vacant lot owned by the State Parks.&nbsp; In that early
depiction of 1856, one can spy the plaza from within the ruined compound
walls of the Neophyte Family Housing Area, and in fact, a careful study
of the illustration reveals the northwestern portion of the nunnery’s courtyard
compound, and the remains of another adobe fronting the east side of the
main plaza.&nbsp; In the area now occupied by the Plaza Stables is illustrated
what appears to be a two-storied, porticoed, adobe building; which may
provide the only remaining illustration of the former nunnery initially
constructed in 1815, and expanded in 1832.&nbsp; Similarly, the Ehrenburg
mapping of 1849 -- which can still be seen in the archives room of the
Old Mission Museum -- illustrates the existence of a long, narrow,&nbsp;
range structure which extends nearly the entire length of the east side
of the plaza.&nbsp; That structure approximates the width of the historic
Southwest Convento wing of the Old Mission’s original courtyard, and appears
to include a large walled compound extending to the area of the Taix Lot
and the original site of the Neophyte Family Housing Area.
<P>By 1823, the Native American population of the Old Mission reached an
all time high of some 1,248 native people, with both local Mutsun and Monterey
area natives; and perhaps, resident Tularenos and or Yokut from the San
Joaquin Valley among the residents.&nbsp; Perhaps so as to accommodate
the acculturated or “hispanicized” native inhabitants of the mission, a
series of range type structures were built in the years of 1821, 1822,
and 1824 in the area immediately east of the former monjerio or nunnery
building fronting the east side of the main plaza.
<P><B>The Neophyte Family Housing Area</B>
<P>Archaeological excavations of the Taix Lot, formerly the site of the
Neophyte Family Housing Area, were conducted in 1961 by archaeologist John
Clemmer, and again in the Spring of 1991 by archaeologist Glenn Farris.&nbsp;
In 1989, archaeologists Dallas and Doane reported the results of an archaeological
survey conducted in the previous year.&nbsp; The results of these many
efforts to identify the exact location and contents of the Neophyte Family
Housing area has revealed much about the way in which the “hispanicized”
Native American inhabitants of this period lived at Old Mission San Juan
Bautista.&nbsp; In addition to locating the original siltstone and adobe
foundations of the residential area in question, it was determined that
there existed three free-standing parallel range or barracks-like structures
separated by an open walkway.&nbsp; The structures were found to trend
lengthwise from east and west; with the most northerly structure being
situated adjacent to that part of the El Camino Real that drops off into
that area lying just below the plaza and immediately below the Old Mission
of San Juan Bautista.
<P>Among the many artifacts recovered from the Taix Lot excavation were
included intact basalt pestles for grinding seed and other plant material,
iron knives, baked clay figurines and figurine fragments, circular “gaming”
disks fashioned from broken roof tiles and Mexican lead-glaze ceramic fragments,
Case gin bottle fragments (one of which appears to have been used as a
flaked cutting tool), mytilus and olivella shell beads (including olivella
spire-lopped side-punched and spire-lopped types), Chione pendants, forged
iron nails, a brass thimble, Phoenix buttons, cast iron kettle fragments,
and a variety of mission and Mexican origin ceramics.&nbsp; Said ceramics
include Blue on White Majolica, Mexican lead glazed ceramics, Mexican redware
with interior glazing; English ceramics (including Blue shell-edge, Blue
molded edgeware, and Hand-painted underglaze earthenware), Annular ware,
Brown Transfer-print with Tuscan scenery and Staffordshire Romantic views,
and Chinese Export Porcelain (including Canton ware and Sino-Islamic types).
<P>In the valley just below the northeast face of the main plaza, and immediately
north and west of the Neophyte Family Housing Area, lie the largely vacant
remains of the original Old Mission Orchard of 1805.&nbsp; The mission
orchard was a centerpiece and symbol of the prosperity of the early mission
community’s attempt to transform the landscape of the San Benito Valley.
<P><B>Sidebar: The Old Mission Orchard of 1805</B>
<P>Even today, a single pear tree from the original Mission Orchard stands
as a silent testament to the diligence and determination of the original
mission Indian community and the Franciscan Fathers who originally cultivated
the San Juan Valley and thereby transformed it for years to come.&nbsp;
In the original orchard, it is said that hundreds of fruit trees and grape
vineyards provided for much of the Old Mission’s needs.
<P>The sole surviving pear tree of the Old Mission Orchard was recently
cloned by the students of the California State University Monterey Bay
and the resulting trees produced by way of grafting have been named the
“Monterey Pear” as a tribute to the campus that undertook the project.
<BR>&nbsp;Just prior to the preparation of the cuttings that were taken
from the old pear tree, the tree managed a healthy crop of some twenty-one
pears, and this despite years of neglect and several recent years of very
dry conditions.&nbsp; Though the actual count of pears produced in 1996,
the year the tree was grafted, may have been about twenty or so, locals
are fond of noting that the tree bore one pear for each church in the California
mission chain.
<P>Historically, the Old Mission Orchard was originally encircled by a
massive cattle-bone fence which was the product of the many “matanzas”
or slaughters conducted for the feeding of the mission’s Mutsun Indian,
Mestizo, and European residents.&nbsp; In one early mapping completed in
1852, the orchard area is illustrated with an enclosure of trees, probably
the same eucalyptus and pear trees illustrated in photos from the 1870’s.&nbsp;
The boundaries of the 1852 mapping represent those boundaries that existed
as a result of the Mexican and American period occupations and parceling
of mission properties. In fact, two of the original “zaguanes” or canals
that once encircled the orchard are still supplying water for crops along
the southeast and northeast boundaries of the original mission orchard.&nbsp;
The area today identified with the mission orchard roughly approximates
those boundaries noted in the mapping of 1852, and the approximate boundaries
noted in then Governor Pio Pico’s bill of sale for the Old Mission Orchard.
<P>During the course of the 1920’s, the Old Mission Orchard was reduced
to little more than a vacant field of grasses with a single ancient pear
tree to bear witness to its past as a mission orchard.&nbsp; By the 1930’s,
the field was converted into a rodeo grounds complete with concrete bleachers,
fencing, and stairways.&nbsp; Though the rodeos were quite popular in their
day, and attracted people from throughout California and the Southwest,
including many a celebrity, the rodeo was eventually abandoned and the
former rodeo grounds allowed to go fallow once more.&nbsp; According to
longtime residents, the rodeo began to attract undesirable elements from
other communities, and when not in use, the rodeo grounds were said to
have became a nightly “hangout” for local youth and many a vagrant.

<P><B>Chapter IV: 19th Century Transformations and Changes</B></CENTER>

<P>The 19th Century saw the rapid expansion and the rapid decline of the
Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; While the mission prospered through
the first two decades of the 19th Century, the Mexican Independence movement
of 1810 to 1824 indirectly undermined the development of the missions of
Alta California.&nbsp; With supplies and resources at a premium, and the
escalation of the Independence movement gaining momentum in Mexico, the
mission communities were faced with mounting pressures to contribute church
resources to the maintenance of Spain’s presidios and provincial administrators.&nbsp;
The ultimate blow would come with the California borne movement to privatize
mission holdings by way of the Secularization Decree of 1832.
<P><B>Mission Secularization and the Mexican Era</B>
<P>While the founding of the twenty-one mission communities of Alta California
spanned a period of some fifty-four years, the Mexican period spanned only
twenty-two years; nevertheless, this era marked one of the most dynamic,
and at the same time, catastrophic periods for early California history.&nbsp;
In 1824, insurgents representing the Republican government of Mexico overthrew
the government of New Spain; thereby ending three centuries of Spanish
colonial domination in the New World.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, the new government
of Mexico sought to expell all Spaniards from the Mexican Republic lest
they swear allegiance to the fledgling government.
<P>In 1859, American President James Buchannon approved legislation mandating
the return of some 55 acres of former mission lands to the parish of San
Juan and the Diocese of Monterey.&nbsp; This gesture provided the first
indication by the American government that mission holdings were off limits
to privatization and squatters.&nbsp; The heated debates in congress that
anticipated the return of portions of the formerly vast holdings of the
California mission communities was largely seen as an attempt to further
communicate American discontent with the former Mexican governance of the
province in question.
<P><B>Growth of town, relative quiet at the Mission [p]</B>
<P><B>Train to Hollister [p] bypassed San Juan Bautista and saved it for
posterity.</B>
<P>Though San Juan vied for the attention of the railroad in 1876, the
rail route and station were ultimately routed through Hollister.&nbsp;
As a result, San Juan declined while Hollister rapidly grew into the new
economic and social center of the region.
<P><B>General Castro, Colonel Fremont and the American Civil War</B>
<P>On the eve of the American takeover of Upper California in 1846, Colonel
Fremont and his troops traversed the San Benito Valley en route to the
Salinas Valley and the Natividad.&nbsp; General Mariano Castro, the alcalde
of San Juan and the regional governor of the Mexican territory used San
Juan and his home, the Castro-Breen Adobe, as his headquarters for the
northern campaign against the American invaders.
<P>During the course of the American Civil War, San Juan boasted its share
of Confederate sympathizers.&nbsp; Wary of potential conflicts in this
part of California, Union soldiers were stationed at San Juan for the course
of the war.&nbsp; Though no actual conflicts occured in San Juan, the potential
for conflict resulted in the creation of a temporary garrison located on
the main plaza.&nbsp; Temporary quarters for Union soldiers were had in
the upper floor of Plaza Hall, the former monjerio or nunnery and Zanetta
family home.
<P><B>Victorian Period Alterations at Old San Juan</B>
<P>While the first thirty-three years of the 19th Century proved most productive
to the development of Old Mission San Juan, the period from 1833 through
1840 proved catastrophic.&nbsp; In the few years immediately following
the secularization of Old Mission San Juan, the Mutsune, Tulareno and Yokut
Indian inhabitants had all but abandoned their former homes and holdings
in the San Benito Valley.&nbsp; Mexican government officials and colonists
rapidly moved onto what once constituted the mission and Mutsune Indian
community.&nbsp; During this period, archaeology suggests that the Old
Southwest Convento burned to the ground during a time when it was occupied
by Mexican government bureacrats and colonists.&nbsp; Soon after the devastation
of the convento and quadrangle, the old adobe buildings of that sector
simply melted away.
<P>In the Informes report of 1840, the Reverend Antonio Anzar speaks bitterly
of the destruction of the mission and its holdings, and the dispersal of
the native Mutsune population.&nbsp; At this same time, Governor Pio Pico
and General Castro were at work accounting for and freely distributing
the last of the Old Mission’s formerly vast holdings to Mexican grantees.&nbsp;
So it was that from the Secularization of 1832 until the return of the
Mission’s holdings by the United States government in 1855, the Old Mission
was allowed to wither away, and with the exception of the main Church and
existing Convento wing, many of its original buildings were confiscated
and or allowed to fall into ruin.
<P>Not until Father Cipriano Rubio’s 1874 modifications and renovations
do we have any accounting of efforts to enhance or restore the existing
buildings of Old Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Ironically, while Father
Rubio is credited with the construction of the mission’s only tower-like
belfry in 1874, the original torreon or “guard tower” that once stood at
the end of the existing Convento appears to have fallen into ruin or been
dismantled in the period between 1852 and 1870.
<P><B>Father Rubio’s Victorian Belltower</B>
<P>In the area immediately above the baptistery is a room adjacent to the
ancient choir loft situated over the main entrance of the church.&nbsp;
This second tier room once served as the summit of a massive adobe staircase
to the choir loft constructed in 1824 (?), and removed after the earthquake
of 1906.&nbsp; Today, this room leads to a doorway that extends into an
adjacent room that remains unrestored, and which includes adobe walls and
flooring, ancient construction debris, and chalk graffiti dating to the
period just after the earthquake of 1906.&nbsp; In this location there
exists an arch-shaped colonial era window that once faced onto the main
plaza when the old baptistery room and second-floor room and tower originally
fronted the plaza proper.&nbsp; Today, the window in question faces into
the area underneath the tiled roof of the arcade and plaza oriented portion
of the Old Convento Wing.
<P>In 1874, Reverend Cipriano Rubio (1865-1875) commissioned San Juan merchant
and carpenter, Steve Lavagnino, to construct a New England-styled wooden
bell tower and steeple in the area immediately adjacent to the baptistery
room on the plaza side of the Old Mission Church.&nbsp; According to the
San Benito Advance of September 5, 1874, “The belfry of the old mission
church was completed on Easter Monday and it gives quite an ornamental
appearance to the plaza...For architectural design and finish it cannot
be excelled.”&nbsp; At that time, Father Rubio used the area immediately
above and adjacent to the baptistery room, and underneath the bells of
the bell tower, as his personal apartment.&nbsp; According to local lore,
Father Rubio hung the ropes to the bells within the bell tower in the area
just above his bedroom.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is said that this was done
so as to allow Father Rubio the convenience of being able to toll the ancient
Mexican bells of Old Mission San Juan without having to leave the comfort
of his bed.
<P>On April 2nd of 1897, the San Benito Advance reported that Father Cipriano
Rubio’s successor, the Reverend Valentin Closa (1875-1909), “has had the
conical tower taken down from the mission church.&nbsp; It was entirely
out of keeping with the ancient edifice.&nbsp; When the improvement is
complete it will be as it was originally and in keeping with the rest of
the edifice.”&nbsp; By that date, the belltower and its steeply pitched
steeple suffered extensive damage as the result of area storms.&nbsp; The
clapboard-covered belltower shaft itself, however, was spared and was subsequently
resurfaced with stucco and covered with a Mission-styled cuppula or dome
that remained until the tower was finally dismantled in its entirety in
1949.&nbsp; Ironically, the tower was removed prior to the production of
Alfred Hitchcock’s motion picture Vertigo in 1953.&nbsp; As it turns out,
the Victorian bell tower was written into Alfred Hitchcock’s script as
a critically important scene in which Jimmy Stewart suffers a bout with...;
yes, you guessed it, vertigo!&nbsp; Unfortunately, Alfred Hitchcock was
then unaware that the belltower had been dismantled prior to the scheduled
arrival of his film crews and actors in the community of San Juan Bautista.
<P><B>The Mission’s Orphanage</B>
<P><B>Sidebar: A Chronology of the Priesthood</B>
<P>In the two hundred years of its existence, the Old Mission of San Juan
Bautista has maintained an unbroken record of religious service and devotion.&nbsp;
In addition to the original nine Franciscans that served San Juan in the
period from 1797 through 1854, as of this writing, twenty-one parish priests
-- primarily Diocesan and Marynoll Fathers -- have served Old Mission San
Juan since 1854.
<P>While a number of those mission clergy listed below also served in the

<P><B>La Gran Fiesta de San Juan</B>
<P>In tracing the initial efforts that ultimately culminated with the major
restoration efforts that preceded San Juan’s celebration of the American
bicentennial in 1976; we must turn to the period shortly after the earthquake
of 1906.&nbsp; In that year, Father Valentine Closa appealed to the parish
community of San Juan, and his call for help quickly spread far and wide.&nbsp;
By 1907, the community organized the beginnings of what has become an annual
fund-raising drive and Fiesta specifically aimed at the restoration and
maintenance of the Old Mission’s historic fabric and contents.
<BR>&nbsp;In an effort to raise the needed funds to restore the Old Mission,
San Juan residents organized the first in a long line of Rodeo’s and annual
Fiesta’s aimed at celebrating both the heritage and history, and promoting
the historic preservation of, the Old Mission of San Juan.&nbsp; The first
Fiesta was staged on Saint John’s Day -- June 24th -- of 1907.&nbsp; Beginning
with the replacement and rededication of a thirty foot tall redwood cross
on Mt. Holy Cross (a.k.a., “Pagan Hill”), the festivities began with a
horse-drawn parade around and within the area of the main plaza fronting
the Old Mission.&nbsp; Many a San Juan Fiesta and Pageant of the 1920’s
and 1930’s attracted noted celebrities; including then Governor Merriam,
Lt. Governor Hatfield, San Francisco Mayor Rossi, child star Jane Withers,
actress Sally Blaine and her husband movie director Norman Foster, and
actors Jimmy “James” Gleason and Lucille Gleason, Tom Brown, and Hollywood
motion picture star Neil Hamilton.
<P>Over the years, the Pageants and Fiestas served to fulfill some of the
basic needs required of the restoration of the mission; however, the greatest
damage to the Old Mission Church was well beyond the community’s means
to raise funds for the restoration.&nbsp; A number of Father Closa’s notes
and letters speak to the high cost of repairing and maintaining those portions
of the Old Mission damaged in the 1906 earthquake.&nbsp; As late at the
1950’s, Father Sullivan wrote of the high cost of having sought the advice
of an “expert” who suggested that the restoration of the Old Mission Church
was not feasible, and that it would be in the best interests of the parish
to see to it that the entire mission Church and Convento be razed and replaced
with a new building fashioned from steel I-beams and concrete.&nbsp; As
a result of the nearly one-million dollar price tag projected for the operation
in question, a potential benefactor who had pledged over $250,000 withdrew
interest in the “restoration” in question.

<P><B>Sidebar: The Mission Model of Atascadero</B>
<P>In 1950, the new hospital for the criminally insane was completed at
Atascadero, California, and soon thereafter, the counselors, therapists
and doctors of the Atascadero State Mental Hospital began the task of working
toward the rehabilitation of those inmates who could be helped.&nbsp; One
of the new therapists at Atascadero was Mr. Al Vercoutere, whose efforts
to provide guidance and therapy for the inmates centered on his efforts
to engage his charges with the task of taking on the work of history and
model-making.&nbsp; According to Mr. Vercoutere, in 1953, he and a group
of inmates under his care began work on a most ambitious project; that
being, the construction of a scale model reproduction of the Old Mission
of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Beginning with a projected floorplan obtained
through the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Vercoutere laid plans for a project
that would engage his interests and diligent efforts for the next eighteen
months.
<P>During the course of that period, Mr. Vercoutere and his charges worked
to build perhaps the most detailed scale model ever undertaken with respect
to the California missions.&nbsp; In addition to a scale model that included
all existing 1950’s era adobe structures of the Old Mission, Mr. Vercoutere
and his team also projected the reconstruction of the Southwest and Northwest
Convento Wings that formerly served to enclose a courtyard, and thereby,
project the appearance of the Old Mission Quadrangle as it may have appeared
in the colonial era.&nbsp; Not only did the inmates and Mr. Vercoutere
follow the Smithsonian’s architectural plans with extreme care, but they
also went to the extent of building scale model doors, windows, picture
frames, and an altar screen in wood, with all walls covered in plaster
over canvas.&nbsp; The roof tiles were in turn fired from half-inch thick
slabs of textured adobe clay originally obtained on site at Old Mission
San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Because they were working in the 1950’s, and because
Mr. Vercoutere chose to exclude any non-original and non-Colonial era features,
the model did not include the Victorian period belltower that once graced
the south half of the church’s main entrance from about 1870 until 1949.&nbsp;
In addition, because the campanile or bell cote that currently graces the
north side of the church entrance was not added by Sir Harry Downey and
crew until the 1976 restoration of the mission church, no campanile is
included in the Atascadero mission model.&nbsp; In the end, the Atascadero
model grew to cover a platform measuring over sixteen by sixteen feet in
size; and as such, this model -- created by the inmates of the Atascadero
State Mental Hospital -- likely continues to hold sway as the largest mission
model in the California mission model chain.

<P><B>Mission Restoration Since 1906</B><B></B>
<P>In the 1930’s, the residents of the community of San Juan Bautista,
with the assistance of crews from the Works Progress Administration, undertook
a number of major renovations and additions at the Old Mission.&nbsp; At
this time, a new rectory building was constructed, the Victorian belltower
was renovated, and the adobe wall encircling the mission courtyard and
adjacent properties was constructed.&nbsp; In addition, it was at this
time that the so-called “Indian Jail,” adjacent to the Chapel of 1799,
was restored.&nbsp; Prior to its restoration, the old two storied tower
was little more than a ruined adobe.&nbsp; The workmen who completed the
“Jails” restoration left behind an inscription on a cabinet door of the
upper story.&nbsp; There they inscribed the names of Fathers Tapis, Cuesta,
and Ullibarri adjacent to that of General M. H. Sherman and Harry Carr.&nbsp;
The dates of 1812 and 1932 were carved into a set of doors adjacent an
inscription that reads: “Come Quickly, Go Away Slowly.”&nbsp; Adjacent
to the tower, the workman erected a series of rooms built from poured concrete
that were initially used as the rectory buildings of the 1930’s through
1960’s.&nbsp; The rectory wing, consisting of three smaller rooms separated
by a garden walkway from an adjacent living room area, was constructed
from concrete prepared at the local cement plant.&nbsp; Though it is unclear
whether or not the builders knew of the existence of an earlier such building
at that same location; archaeology has revealed the existence of an original
mission wall foundation that roughly coincides with the 1930’s rectory.
<P>Again in the 1950’s, volunteers and work crews set about the task of&nbsp;
working to restore the original mission buildings.&nbsp; At that time,
a number of Victorian period additions were removed and the mission was
returned to its original appearance.&nbsp; Among other changes, the wooden
paneling that had been nailed to the ceiling of the main church, and the
Victorian bell tower were both removed.&nbsp; The Victorian bell tower,
which had been modified in the 1930’s with a stucco facing and a tiled
roof so as to conform with the overall style of the mission buildings,
was finally dismantled in 1950.
<P><B>The American Bicentennial</B>
<P>San Juan has had the unique distinction of having a direct role to play
in the celebration and acknowledgement of two significant historical events
in the history of North America.&nbsp; The first of these events is important
in terms of both local and regional historical traditions; that being the
founding of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista on the Northern Frontier
of New Spain’s imperial domain on 24 June of 1797.&nbsp; The second major
historical event bears both local and national significance in that it
centers on the founding of the United States of America on 4 July of 1776.&nbsp;
In preparation for the celebration of the American Bicentennial on July
4th of 1976, preparations at the Old Mission began well in advance with
the efforts to restore the main church; the side-aisles of which were damaged
in the devastating earthquake of 1906.
<P>By the late 1960’s, and early 1970’s, the community of San Juan, and
particularly the San Juan Historical Society and Fiesta committee’s intensified
their efforts to raise the money needed for the restoration of the church.&nbsp;
The impending American Bicentennial celebration provoked a great deal of
interest for the project in question.&nbsp; Revenues from the Rodeo and
Fiesta increased and moneys raised in previous years was pooled so as to
raise the nearly one-million dollars required for a full-fledged restoration,
as opposed to replacement, of the Old Mission Church and its side-aisles.
<P>Beginning in 1974, the arduous task of planning and implementing the
reconstruction of the Church side-aisles began in earnest.&nbsp; The principal
architect of the plan was Sir Harry Downey, a master craftsmen and veteran
of previous mission restorations, who had single-handedly undertaken and
completed the full-fledged restoration of the mission of San Carlos de
Borromeo or Carmel under the sponsorship of the Hearst Foundation.&nbsp;
Unlike his earlier ventures at San Carlos, or Carmel mission, Sir Harry
Downey supervised the reconstruction of the walls of the side-aisles of
the main church of San Juan.&nbsp; This task, which required some three
years to complete, was funded in large part by the efforts of the mission
restoration fund initiated by Father Closa many years before.
<P>Because the cost of rebuilding the side-aisles required nearly one million
dollars, San Juan residents, in league with the Fiesta and Rodeo committees
and the Diocese of Monterey managed to raise that money required of the
restoration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Local workmen were recruited to recreate the thousands
upon thousands of adobe bricks required for the restoration of the massive
side-aisles.&nbsp; In addition, because many of the original timbers used
to roof the side-aisles were destroyed in the earthquake of 1906, workers
were also recruited to rebuild and restore the roof and ceiling of the
side-aisles.&nbsp; In this effort, workers were put to the task of using
primitive adzes and axes in an effort to reproduce the rough-hewn appearance
of the remaining original roofing members.
<P>Because the restoration demanded that the original archways be reopened,
it was necessary to retrofit the side aisles for protection against continuing
seismic activity.&nbsp; To this end, the State of California demanded that
all adobes be tested, and that steel cabling be used in the flooring so
as to anchor walls and archways.&nbsp; Though the workmen used cement mixers
to create the mixture of clay, hay and manure required to produce durable,
State inspected and approved and seismically stable adobe bricks, every
other step in the adobe brick manufacturing process followed those procedures
used in the Spanish colonial era.
<P>The reopening the sealed archways of the main church required the removal
of tons of adobe bricks placed in 1812 under the orders of Father Arroyo
de la Cuesta.&nbsp; According to workman who participated in the restoration,
the removal of the adobe bricks from the archways revealed fragments of
paint and portions of the original painted decorations of the main church.&nbsp;
Despite the recovery of these original sections, it was decided that the
repainting of the church would follow from decorations identified with
the main altar reredos painted by Thomas Doak in 1818.
<P>With the north and south walls of the main church rebuilt, the side-aisle
archways reopened, and the floors and ceilings restored, the repainting
of the main church was left to architectural historian Norman Neuerburg.&nbsp;
Given the fragility of those mural fragments recovered within the archways,
it was not possible to conserve the surviving portions of the original
mission decor.&nbsp; As such, Neuerburg proceeded with the decoration of
the main church, and did so on the basis of a combination of designs based
on those of the main altar reredos and the repainting and recreation of
known mural fragments.
<P>Prior to completion of the 1976 restoration effort, Sir Harry Downey
redirected the restoration crews to the construction of a campanario or
campanile for the bronze bells of mission San Juan.&nbsp; Though the Old
Mission did not originally boast a campanario, Sir Harry Downey believed
that since the Franciscan padres had originally intended to build a bell
tower that it would be appropriate to proceed with the construction of&nbsp;
a campanario.&nbsp; As such, Downey modeled the construction of the campanile
after that at the Old Mission of San Diego de Alcala -- the first of the
mission churches of Alta California.&nbsp; And although San Juan is thought
to have originally maintained a grouping of some nine bronze church bells
-- only six of which can be documented -- only three of the original bells
remain at Old Mission San Juan.&nbsp; And of these, two were recast at
the turn of the century so as to repair cracks and other defects in the
original bells.

<P><B>Chapter IV: Mission San Juan Bautista Today</B></CENTER>

<P><B>Diocesan Fathers</B>
<P><B>Sidebar: San Antonio’s Halo</B>
<P>San Antonio or Saint Anthony is cherished in the Catholic community
as the patron of lost objects, and ironically, for Old Mission San Juan
Bautista, even San Antonio is not immune to loss.
<P>Throughout the course of the 19th Century, the four foot statue of San
Antonio -- that today stands in the upper left-hand corner of the main
altar of the Old Mission’s Church -- has presided over events both great
and small.&nbsp; Having survived largely unscathed for nearly a century,
the events of the great earthquake of 1906 were to change San Antonio’s
angelic appearance.&nbsp; As the result of the earthquake that brought
down the side-aisles of the main Church, the santos were removed from the
main altar out of fear that aftershocks might bring down the massive church.
<P>At this time, services were shifted to the Convento Wing -- now the
Old Mission Museum -- and a temporary altar was set up in what had formerly
constituted the two rooms adjacent the Sala or “Room of the Four Chimneys.”&nbsp;
Photographs of the time clearly show San Antonio and the other saints of
the main altar in new locations on the floors of the Convento Wing.&nbsp;
In one such photo, the ornately crafted silver halo of San Antonio is clearly
evident; that however, would be the last time the saint would bear his
halo in public for a period of nearly eighty-nine years.
<P>As fate would have it, the story of San Antonio’s halo would find new
life in October of 1995, when the parish office received a phone call from
a family recently relocated to the community of Salinas, California.&nbsp;
On that occasion, the parish office was informed by the family in question
that they wished to donate a silver candle-stick to the mission.&nbsp;
According to the story given, the candle-stick in question had been acquired
at a swap meet in the area, and not long after the purchase, the family
in question moved to Saint Louis, Missouri.&nbsp; After fifteen years,
the family packed up its belongings, and the silver candle-stick, and returned
to Salinas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the fact that the candle-stick bore the inscribed
name of “San Juan Bautista,” the family in question decided that it would
be appropriate to donate the candle-stick to Old Mission San Juan Bautista.
<P>Shortly after receiving the candle-stick, the parish priest contacted
curator Sir Richard Menn so as to have the artifact cleaned and restored.&nbsp;
Though slightly damaged, the silver artifact was in remarkably good condition,
particularly given its age and the circuitous odyssey that saw it back
to San Juan.&nbsp; Upon completion of the restoration of the purported
candle-stick, suspicions emerged over the rather imposing spike with the
rectangular cross-section dominating the center of the so-called “candle-stick.”&nbsp;
In the ensuing days and weeks, the parish priest began searching the mission’s
photo archives for evidence pointing to the original use of the silver
artifact.&nbsp; After some searching, the parish priest had his answer,
and in October of 1995, he climbed the ancient wooden staircase that serves
as primary access to the altar screen of the main church and soon received
confirmation of his suspicions.&nbsp; Upon peering into the top of the
sculpted wooden head of San Antonio, the reverend father found a hole with
a rectangular cross-section that appeared to match the fit of the spike
on the so-called “candle-stick;” so on a Sunday morning mass in October
1995, the parish priest announced to his parish that they were about to
experience a little bit of history.&nbsp; Climbing the staircase of the
altar screen, the assembled congregation anxiously awaited the historical
revelation in question, and soon the parish priest appeared within the
niche that holds the sculpture of San Antonio.&nbsp; And so it was that
the Patron of the Poor and of lost objects was again crowned with the silver
“halo” that mysteriously disappeared shortly after the cataclysmic events
of 1906.

<P><B>The Archaeology of a California Mission</B>
<P>Beginning in the Fall of 1995, the students of the California State
University Monterey Bay and a host of community volunteers under my direction
undertook the beginnings of what has become a long term effort to explore,
research, and restore the archaeology and historical collections of Old
Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; In October of 1995, a preliminary mapping
of the Old Mission Courtyard was soon followed by the layout of a series
of excavation units and trenches aimed at identifying the subsurface cultural
and historical resources of the Old Mission Quadrangle.
<P>At the outset, a number of visiting historians and archaeologists discounted
the likelihood that our team would encounter evidence for the existence
of the Old Mission’s former “quadrangle.”&nbsp; One architectural historian
was quick to suggest that the purported mission quadrangle was never built,
and that the Old Mission complex was never completed as originally envisioned.&nbsp;
Because no existing mappings or historic illustrations of the old mission
bore clear-cut evidence for the former existence of a courtyard enclosure
bounded on the southwest and northwest by convento-like structures.&nbsp;
Once excavations began, both a visiting archaeologist and the aforementioned
architectural historian then argued that even had such an enclosure existed
in the past, any evidence for its location would have been destroyed by
the cutting of the roadbed for the expansion of 2nd Street that skirts
the perimeter of the mission grounds on the southwest perimeter.
<P>And so it was that by December of 1995, the archaeologists began excavations
in the courtyard area of the Old Mission, and in so doing, located the
foundations of the Southwest Convento Wing and the Old Mission Well.&nbsp;
Soon thereafter, excavations were directed to exposing a cross-section
of the SW Convento Wing.&nbsp; Within Trench 1 were excavated Canton bowls,
Flow Blue dinnerware, Shell Edged plates, Majolica, shards and related
Spanish, Mexican, and European porcelains, blown-glass wine bottles of
the early 19th Century, Native American stone and shell beads and related
artifacts, and a variety of&nbsp; other items including bone-handled knives
and forks, Spanish era canon and musket balls, a variety of metal works,
and American era coins.&nbsp; By the Fall of 1996, excavations shifted
to the southern end of the existing Convento Wing.&nbsp; At that location
were recovered the foundations of the original Torreon or Tower that once
stood at the south corner of the mission quadrangle.
