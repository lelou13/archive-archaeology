<CENTER><B>The Mystery in History</B>
<BR><B>An Interactive Learning Experience in a California Mission</B>
<BR><I>Draft of September 22nd, 1998</I></CENTER>
<IMG SRC="tealbar.jpg" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" HEIGHT=6 WIDTH=100%>
<B>Target Audience:</B>
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High School Students enrolled in social studies
classes
<BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second language users and learners: Spanish and
English
<BR>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide variety of reading levels from fully functional,
critical readers to non-readers
<BR>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who generally find history and social science
irrelevant to their lives
<P><B>Goal:</B>
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create learning scenarios which engage students
in structured social science research and which demonstrate relevance to
concrete learning outcomes and personal experience.
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop multimedia that engages the use of digitized
imagery, video, and related resources created by way of the Alta California
Mission Research Project at San Juan Bautista.
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate individual and group proficiency with
the use and development of multimedia learning materials from archaeological
and historical archaeological contexts.
<P><B>Questions:</B>
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What effect did the missions have on post-Mission
era architectural styles (e.g. modern California architecture more generally)?
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How and why did the architecture and layout of
Mission San Juan change over time?
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is it possible that an entire community came
to forget the prior existence of the Old Mission's original quadrangle?
<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it possible that the failure of the Old Mission's
priests to document the devastation of the quadrangle led to the loss of
the quadrangle from community memory?
<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there something that prevented the priest from
keeping records?
<P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have we not looked in all the right places?
<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did the missions affect the cultural development
of the area?
<P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would you take a tour of the mission?
<P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What natural resources and environmental conditions
drew people to the area?
<P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spanish agricultural potential, established trade
routes?
<P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural conflict?
<P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What factors lead to cultural conflicts?:
a. Native Americans/Spanish
<BR>b. Spanish/Americans</BLOCKQUOTE>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What were the underlying factors related to Hispanic/Mexican
migration?:
a. Social and historical underpinnings
<BR>b. Resource related underpinnings
<BR>c. Economic and political factors which sped the colonization
<BR>d. Spiritual factors the mechanism by which it happen</BLOCKQUOTE>
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What methods do professional practitioners use to
answer these questions:
a. History
<BR>b. Archaeology
<BR>c. Art Historical
<BR>d. Cultural Geography
<BR>e. Historical Archaeology
<BR>f. Visual Anthropology
<BR>g. Museum Studies:
i. How do you preserve and interpret the past?
<BR>ii. What the relationship between man and the environment?
<BR>iii. How has the role of the mission changed through time?
<BR>iv. Where did the porcelains – recovered archaeologically -- originate?
<BR>v. What do the artifacts have to say about the relative affluence of
the Old Mission?
<BR>vi. How did trade affect the mission through the course of time?</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Treatment: </B>Students visit the mission (by actual or virtual tour).
Students interview appropriate historical figures, examine artifacts.
<P>1. Oregon Trail type simulation, Carmen San Diego, Myst
a. Case Studies (stories): Thomas Doak and the anchor. How
would you prove that this was his anchor? Tombstone and anchor in cabinet.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Scenarios:</B>
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual Mission Tour:
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students begin by asking the archaeologists:
Why are you digging in the Old Mission courtyard?
<BR>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archaeologists respond with answer beginning with
an overview of the primary goals of archaeology, then move to the hypothetical
existence of a former convento wing in the area – the Lost Convento!
<BR>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local historian intervenes and argues that there
never was a quadrangle at said location.
<BR>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archaeologist, and project Art Historian, question
the assumptions of the Historian: They contend that just because no documentary
evidence exists to demonstrate the existence of the quadrangle does not
mean that no quadrangle once existed at that location!
<BR>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historian further argues that no documentary evidence
– particularly that in the form of maps or architectural plans -- exists
to indicate that the mission was built on a quadrangle layout, and therefore,
it's not possible that a quadrangle existed at said location.
<BR>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A university Historian arrives on the scene and
in turn questions the local historians handle on the information by saying:
Not even the local histories provide sufficient information so as to say
for sure whether or not a quadrangle existed at the Old Mission at any
particular point in time.
<BR>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a lot to do with trade, resources, social
interaction and strategic and defensive needs of the Old Mission community
of San Juan.
<BR>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Project Photo Historian counters: Though we
have some indications of a quadrangle, these center mostly on only early
sketches of a perimeter tower at the southern corner of what might have
constituted the quadrangle.
<BR>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students ask about the age or dates ascribed to
the "Tower": We keep hearing from our teacher about an Old Guard Tower,
is that what you're talking about, and if so, how old and how large was
the tower?</BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Are there tunnels under these streets of San Juan Bautista?
<P><B>Components:</B>
<P>1. Index of Research Methods and Data Sources.
<BR>2. Glossary of Mission Material Culture (Cultural Glossary) or Index
<BR>3. Visual or Virtual Inventory of archaeological collections (requires
digitizing of artifacts on flatbed scanner and use of project photos so
as to indicate areas from which items originated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
