<BR><B>The Bicentennial of Old Mission San Juan Bautista</B>
<P>On June 24th, 1997, the community of San Juan Bautista celebrated the
200th anniversary of the Old Mission’s founding by Father Fermin Francisco
de Lasuen.&nbsp; Between June 21st and 24th of 1997, the Old Mission and
community of San Juan Bautista celebrated with an early morning mass, a
Mutsun Indian religious blessing, Native American dances, an Old Timer’s
parade, a rededication of the original Chapel of 1799, and a host of activities
generally associated with the annual Fiesta Pageant or Old Mission’s annual
celebration and carnival that originated shortly after the 1906 earthquake
that damaged portions of the Old Mission’s original monastery and church
side aisles.&nbsp; The many thousands of visitors and participants who
converged on San Juan for the events of the Old Mission’s bicentennial
celebration were there to celebrate more than the passing of 200 years
in the mission’s history, they had come to relive the many events, rekindle
the friendships, and celebrate the life history of a community that has
seemingly survived the centuries unscathed by the progress and development
that has transformed many of the original Spanish colonial settlements
within which the missions were originally founded.
<P>The setting of the Old Mission and community of San Juan Bautista is
both unique and historic.&nbsp; As the principal crossroads of the expeditions
to and from the interior of Alta or Upper California, it served for a time
as the principle economic and cultural crossroads of early California;
and it is located in the only surviving Spanish colonial-era plaza in California
and the American Southwest, perched atop the great ledge of the Pacific
Plate, adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.&nbsp; Old Mission San Juan Bautista
provides the most important picture of the culture and character of early
California and the Family of Missions.

<BR><B>The Old Mission: Visiting San Juan Bautista</B>
<P>The Old Mission and its colonial era plaza, and well preserved buildings
is a primary destination for visitors from around the world, and for families
and students from throughout California.&nbsp; Some 40,000 to 60,000 fourth
grade students and teachers visit each year as well as some 400,000 tourists.&nbsp;
Students and visitors generally begin with a tour of the Old Mission and
proceed from there to the Plaza Hotel, and continue through the Castro-Breen
Adobe, the Livery Stable and Zanetta House, the Old Jail, and the Vicki
Cottage and adjacent gardens.&nbsp; It should be noted that educational
field trips are part of the State-mandated California history studies requirement
for all fourth grade students; and Old Mission San Juan Bautista serves
as a vibrant, living testament to early California and Mission history
for these young students.
<P>The Old Mission, and the plaza, has many treasures for all its visitors;
picturesque surroundings, Spanish colonial and Mutsun Indian artifacts,
and a collection of Mexican and early American buildings and furnishings.&nbsp;
There is a genuine, historic atmosphere to this early California community
with the Old Mission at its center.&nbsp; Even today, a number of San Juan
residents count themselves the descendants of the earliest Californians.&nbsp;
Whether you meet the oldest of San Juan residents on main street, or within
the corridors of the Old Mission and parish of San Juan, their historic
surnames include Anzar, Larios, Castro, Taix, Breen, Sayers, Vasquez, Zanetta,
and a cast of hundreds of early pioneer families and native descendants.&nbsp;
This, and the pristine setting of Old Mission San Juan Bautista and this
historic community serve to enhance what many have come to call the unique
“spiritual” character of this timeless place, where both history and community
are one and the same.

<P><B>Chapter I: The Early History</B></CENTER>

<P>Long before the first Spanish and Mexican colonists and American settlers
entered the San Juan Valley, generations of Native American peoples lived
in the region.&nbsp; Over the years the discovery of ancient arrowheads,
spear points, shell beads, and human burials and animal bone, has provided
direct evidence that the ancestors of the Ohlone Mutsun and related peoples
first settled the San Benito area some 5,000 to 6,000 years before the
present. In those times, the region was quite lush, and the area immediately
below the Old Mission consisted of a vast flood plain and tule marsh.&nbsp;
As such, wildlife was plentiful, and waterfowl were abundant.&nbsp; The
Ohlone Mutsun relied for food and shelter on the availability of riverine
and marsh-related resources, particularly tule reed and waterfowl.&nbsp;
In addition, archaeology and history tell us that within the San Juan Valley
itself, the ancestors of the Ohlone Mutsun hunted Black-Tail Deer, Tule
Elk, Pronghorn Antelope, and a host of smaller creatures including the
Jack Rabbit.&nbsp; On the other hand, the “San Juaneros” so revered the
Grizzly Bear that they deified it in their myths and legends from the earliest
of times.
<P><B>Native Lifeways Before the Mission</B>
<P>The Mutsun constitute a regional branch of the larger Costanoan or Ohlone
culture of the Pacific Coast.&nbsp; This larger grouping of peoples inhabited
the coastal and inland areas of that area extending from Monterey Bay through
to and including the San Francisco Bay area of Central and Northern California.&nbsp;
Their’s was a culture that was well adapted to the coastal and inland resource
areas of the region in question.&nbsp; Because of the relatively abundant,
though seasonal nature of both plant and animal resources and foods in
such a vast area, the Ohlone maintained extensive village base camps adjacent
to rivers and streams, while opting for seasonal encampments in the quest
for other desired seasonal or region-specific resources.
<P>Though initial interpretations by early colonists painted a simple picture
of the native peoples, we now know the Ohlone Mutsun to have constituted
a relatively complex society.&nbsp; Recent archaeological discoveries,
and linguistic studies, indicate the existence of extensive trading networks
established and maintained by the Ohlone Mutsun for the purpose of obtaining
raw resources such as obsidian glass and other important materials used
in the production of arrowheads and stone knives.&nbsp; The evidence for
ancient trade makes clear Ohlone Mutsun social, cultural, linguistic, and
political relationships with other California Native American peoples over
thousands of years.&nbsp; Through these interactions they carved a civilization
from the wilderness.
<P>The archaeological recovery of obsidian glass and chert projectile points
and arrowheads from within and beyond the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista
indicates that the Ohlone traded with areas as distant as the Great Basin
of Nevada, and portions of northeastern and eastern California.&nbsp; From
present-day Lassen and Modok counties, the Ohlone traded for obsidian and
other volcanic stone resources.&nbsp; From Native American groups to the
north and south, principally, other Ohlone and southern coastal Chumash
groups, the Ohlone Mutsun obtained shell ornaments, ear and nose plugs,
and related prestige items.
<P>Even the most casual study reveals the sophistication and artistry of
Ohlone Mutsun Indian basketry technology and traditions.&nbsp; It is equally
clear that basketry and woven fiber clothing was but one of the many unique
innovations that permitted the Mutsun to adapt to the unique social and
environmental conditions of their homeland.
<P>Among other uses, Mutsun baskets were employed in the processing of
acorn seeds, the serving of foods such as atole (corn gruel) or pozole
(beef stew), or the gathering of water, wood, fuel or fiber.&nbsp; And
whether created for domestic purposes or inter-tribal and long-distance
trade and gift-giving, or used in Ohlone Mutsun ritual and ceremony, particularly
for the gathering and burning of sage and other sacred offerings, Mutsun
basketry is a testament not only to their technological ingenuity, innovation,
and sophistication, but to the very deep roots of the Ohlone in the ancient
California wilderness.
<P>Mutsun basketry is among the most sophisticated produced in ancient
California; with its artistic patterns, geometric shapes, colors, fibers,
and designs.&nbsp; As with their rock art, the full social and cultural
meaning of this practical art now eludes us, fortunately however, some
aspects of the language, myths and legends of the Ohlone Mutsun people
have survived, and provide us a sense of the early spiritual and cultural
life of the Mutsun.
<P>Community patterns and the settlements or rancherias of the Ohlone Mutsun
were often substantial settlements of several hundred people per village.&nbsp;
Early accounts of the original founding of the Mutsun village that preceded
the founding of the later community of San Juan are now lost to history.&nbsp;
However, we do know that upon reaching the village that would eventually
serve as the site of the founding of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista,
Mutsune referred to their community as Popeloutchom.
<P><B>The Early Spanish Entrada</B>
<P>On Friday, March 20, 1772, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Franciscan Father
Fray Juan Crespi, and Captain Commander Don Pedro Fages of the Royal Presidio
of San Carlos de Monterey set out on an expedition in search of an overland
route to the harbor of San Francisco.&nbsp; Twelve soldiers, including
six volunteers and six “Leather Jackets” or presidio soldiers, one muleteer,
and one “California Indian” pack mule driver began the journey on that
Friday of the second week of the Christian observance of Lent.&nbsp; A
student of the Presidente of the California mission system, Fray Junipero
Serra, Fray Juan Crespi recorded his arrival in the San Juan Valley on
Sunday, March 22nd of 1772.&nbsp; At that time, Fray Crespi named the area
San Pascual Bailon -- a Catholic saint that continues to stand vigil at
the main altar of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.
<P>Having described the lush surroundings, and the presence of Oak trees
and Redwoods in the region, Fray Crespi also recounted having observed
antelope and the presence of bear tracks in the vicinity of the Rio San
Benito.&nbsp; Also known as San Juan Creek, Fray Crespi noted that the
area would provide adequate resources for settlement and colonization.&nbsp;
Upon his return to the Royal Presidio of Monterey, Fray Crespi’s report
later became the basis for the subsequent settlement of the Rio San Benito
under the direction of the then Father Presidente of the California mission
system, Fray Fermin Francisco de Lasuen of mission San Carlos Borromeo
del Rio Carmelo.
<P><B>The Founding of Old Mission San Juan</B>
<P>After the founding and dedication of Mission San Jose on the 11th of
June of 1797, Fray Fermin Lasuen of Mission San Carlos, the Father-Presidente
of the California missions, dedicated the new mission of San Juan Bautista
on June 24th, 1797.&nbsp; Dedicated in the name of Saint John the Baptist,
whose feast day is that of June 24th, Father Lasuen documented the grand
event with the following accounting included in the titlepage of the baptismal
register:
<BR>&nbsp;
“First Book of Baptisms of Mission San Juan Bautista, Precursor
of Jesus Christ, founded at the expense of the Catholic King of Spain,
Carlos IV..., and by order of His Excellent Lord, the Marquis de Branciforte,
Viceroy of New Spain, on the spot called Popeloutchom by the natives, but
by our people, from the first discovery, San Benito, commenced on the very
day of the Titular Patron Saint, June 24th, 1797.&nbsp; On this day I,
the undersigned Presidente of the Missions of New California, entrusted
by his Majesty to the Apostolic College of the Propagation of the Faith
of San Fernando de Mexico, with the assistance of the Rev. Fathers and
Preachers Apostolic, Fr. Magin Catala and Fr. Joseph Manuel de Martiarena,
and with the aid of the troops destined to guard the establishment, in
the presence of many pagans from the surrounding country, who manifested
much pleasure, etc., I blessed water, the place and the great Cross, which
we planted and venerated.&nbsp; I immediately intoned the Litany of All
Saints, and sang High Mass during which I preached exhorting all to cooperate
for such a holy work.&nbsp; I concluded the function by solemnly singing
the Te Deum.&nbsp; May all be for the greater honor and glory of God, Our
Lord.&nbsp; Amen.”
<BR>&nbsp;“Thus the place is now transformed into the Mission dedicated
to the Glorious Precursor of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Saint John, the Baptist,
on his very own day.&nbsp; Furthermore, by authority of the Apostolic College
of the Propagation of the Faith of San Fernando de Mexico, I named as its
first missionaries the Reverend Fathers Preachers Apostolic, Fr. Joseph
Manuel de Martiarena and Fr. Pedro Adriano Martinez.”
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--- Fr. Fermin Francisco de Lasuen</BLOCKQUOTE>
Established as the fifteenth of what was to be twenty-one California missions,
San Juan was founded at a time when Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen was
beset with the challenges of founding four California missions in a single
year; the missions of San Jose, San Juan, San Miguel, and San Luis Rey
de Francia.&nbsp; And so it was that the missions of San Juan and San Miguel
were built on the basis of a similar design plan.&nbsp; In each, the main
church lies at the north or northeast corner of a quadrangle-enclosed courtyard
complete with a long colonnade fronting the main street or plaza.&nbsp;
This plan, unique to these two missions, created the largest of all the
mission precincts, and today at Old Mission San Juan Bautista one can experience
the quiet nobility of original mission planning.

<BR><B>Tribute to a Mutsun Elder: Ascencion Solorsano de Cervantes</B>
<P>Among the Ohlone Mutsun, one name stands out as a symbol of the persistence
and survival of the most ancient of Native traditions.&nbsp; Ascencion
Solorsano de Cervantes (1855-1930), whose burial in the Old Mission Cemetery
marked the last such burial of a Mutsun elder on the Mission’s grounds,
was a highly respected Medicine Woman and culture hero of the Ohlone Mutsun
tribe.
<P>Shortly before her death in Monterey, California, Ascencion began an
important collaboration with noted anthropologist John Peabody Harrington
of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
<P>Harrington’s primary work was with the recording and collecting of California
Native American legends, oral histories and customs.&nbsp; In the year
prior to her death, Harrington meticulously recorded all that Ascencion
could relate about the culture, history and language of the Ohlone Mutsun
people.&nbsp; In addition to the recorded narratives of the language, culture
and customs of her people, Ascencion provided an important glimpse into
the ancient medicinal traditions of the Mutsun.&nbsp; So impressed was
Harrington with Ascencion Solorsano that upon her death he penned a poem
to the woman who had given so much to the people of the San Benito River
country.
<P>Today, upon entering the Old Mission Cemetery, visitors may see both
an old red cross bearing her name, as well as a beautiful bronze plaque
bearing Harrington’s euology and tribute to this most important of Native
American women.&nbsp; This permanent tribute to Ascencion Solorsano de
Cervantes represents one of the few such tributes to the Native American
peoples of California.
<P><B>Harrington’s Poem</B><B></B>
<P>John Peabody Harrington conducted anthropological and linguistic studies
among California Native American groups through the course of the first
half of the 20th Century.&nbsp; Working tirelessly, and often under difficult
conditions, Harrington amassed a vast body of cultural and linguistic material
on the native peoples of California with the sponsorship of the Smithsonian
Institution.

<BR><B>El Camino Real and the Mission System</B>
<P>From their founding as among the few Spanish settlements north of Monterey,
San Juan Bautista and San Jose — both founded in 1797 — and the missions
of San Francisco de Asis (1776), Santa Cruz (1791), and San Francisco Solano
(1823), served as the Northern Frontier of Spanish Christendom until 1824.&nbsp;
These missions were in turn situated along El Camino Real -- the “King’s
Road” – so as to link the entire mission chain overland to the mission
of San Diego de Alcala – a distance of some 750 miles; and by extension
to Mexico City and the royal seat of the Viceroyalty.&nbsp; As an outpost
along El Camino Real, Old Mission San Juan Bautista was a welcome refuge
from the toil and travails of the rugged road that connected San Juan Bautista
to mission Santa Clara to the north, and the Royal Presidio of Monterey
to the southwest.
<P>In addition to its place on El Camino Real, San Juan was also the frontier
outpost or gateway to California’s extensive central valley and El Camino
Viejo, or “The Old Road” originally chartered by way of the expeditions
of Don Pedro Fages in 1770 and Padre Francisco Garces in 1776.&nbsp; Through
the Pacheco Pass to the east El Camino Viejo then followed the eastern
flank of the coastal range southward to the early Hispanic community of
Rancho San Emigdio located at the foot of the Grapevine Pass in Kern County.&nbsp;
Here, El Camino Viejo divided into two routes, one of which led to the
mission community of Santa Barbara, and the other to the community of Nuestra
Senora de Los Angeles del Rio Porciuncula; or Los Angeles.
<CENTER>
<P><B>&nbsp;Chapter II: 19th Century: Transformation and Change</B></CENTER>

<P>Much of the early growth of Old Mission San Juan centered on the relatively
rapid construction of the original mission quadrangle and a series of early
church buildings and chapels, one of the earliest being the still extant,
restored Chapel of 1799.
<P>In the founding year of the Old Mission, some twenty-eight Mutsun Indian
rancherias were located in and about the location selected as the site
of the mission of San Juan.&nbsp; The Mutsun rancherias themselves typically
consisted of tule reed structures arranged about forecourts or open dance
areas.&nbsp; Such structures were typically heated by rock-lined hearths
within or immediately outside the doors of each shelter.&nbsp; Of the twenty-eight
rancherias of that time, the site of Popeloutchom was chosen as the site
of the Old Mission and its attendant buildings.
<P>The Old Mission Church -- with its extended family and community of
Native American and European parishioners -- was the early focal point
of the social, cultural and religious life of San Juan Bautista and the
Rio San Benito.&nbsp; The massive Church and convento wing that visitors
tour on excursions to San Juan Bautista are the sole surviving architectural
remains of a once large and thriving community of native parishioners and
early colonists.
<P><B>The Old Mission Church</B>
<P>In an elaborate ceremony hosted on June 13th of 1803, Fathers Jose Manuel
de Martiarena and Domingo Iturrate, and a host of dignitaries (including
the then Governor ad interim of the Peninsula of Alta California and Captain
General of the Dominion of New Spain Lieutenant-Colonel Don Jose Joaquin
de Arrillaga); there took place the blessing and laying of the cornerstone
that served to initiate the immense construction project that resulted
in the creation of the largest of the California mission church buildings.
<P>Though the cornerstone of the main Church was laid in 1803, the final
dedication ceremony would need to await the completion of the Church and
the feast day of St. John on June 23rd of 1812.&nbsp; Erected over a massive
-- five foot thick – silt stone foundation, the church has endured two
centuries of relatively constant use and an occasional earthquake or two.
<P><B>The Church Nave and Side Aisles</B>
<P>The side aisles and arcades adjoining the central nave were not initially
proposed as a feature of the original building plan of the main church,
and as such, they appear to have been an afterthought added to the original
plan by Fathers Domingo de Iturrate (1801-1809) and&nbsp; Felipe Arroyo
de la Cuesta (1809-1812 and 1825-1833).&nbsp; Each of the two arcades consist
of six massive columns and seven arches, for a total of fourteen arches
and twelve columns.&nbsp; It is no coincidence that the number of columns
and the number of arches corresponds nicely with the twelve original apostles
of Christ, and the fourteen stations of the Cross.
<P>Shortly after the great earthquake of 1812, and in response to the as
yet relatively small size of the Mutsun Indian congregation, the Padres
sealed the majority of the archways in the arcades separating the side
aisles from the central nave of the Church.&nbsp; At that point, the side
aisles were converted into rooms spanning the width of each of the original
archways.&nbsp; The two archways on each side of the church closest to
the altar remained open so as to serve as side-altars devoted to San Antonio
and San Isidro (santos now located within the main altar screen).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Adobe walls in turn served to divide the side aisles on each side of the
Church into approximately four or five rooms each.&nbsp; At about that
same time, one the arches adjacent to the side-altar on the garden side
of the Church was converted for use as a stairway and platform for the
placement of an ornate and colorful wooden pulpit of Spanish colonial design.&nbsp;
The ornate pulpit is distinguished by the presence of an elaborately carved
hymnal or music stand sculpted in the form of the golden eagle of the Spanish
crown.
<P>Many of the original features of the main Church, including the construction
and painting of the main altar reredos, the original paint of the walls
and sacristy, and the tiled floors were all completed between 1816 and
1818 under the direction of Fray Esteban Tapis.&nbsp; Appropriately enough,
it is Fray Tapis whose ornate marble-covered burial crypt is located at
the left side of the main altar that he designed and constructed.
<P><B>The Main Altar</B>
<P>A runaway American sailor by the name of Thomas Doak -- who deserted
an American merchant ship named the “Albatross” -- sought and found refuge
at the Old Mission.&nbsp; In 1816, Thomas Doak jumped ship along with a
fellow sailor named Bob (a.k.a. Juan Cristobal) at the Puerto de Monterey
and trekked inland along what was then a major thoroughfare to the north
-- El Camino Real.”&nbsp; It was here that Thomas Doak struck a deal with
Franciscan Father Fray Esteban Tapis, who at that moment found himself
hardpressed to come up with the six reales per day required to contract
another painter.&nbsp; Jose Mateo de la Luz Chaves was the Monterey-based
painter who was to have completed the main altar designed by Fray Tapis
within the sanctuary of the newly completed church.&nbsp; Completed in
1812, the main church remained without the altar screen needed to accommodate
the recently acquired santos or saints that would eventually come to grace
the nichos or niches of the completed altar screen.&nbsp; In exchange for
room and board, Thomas Doak completed the painting of the main altar.
<P>Visitors to the mission often confuse the life-sized central image in
the lower tier of the altar screen with that of Jesus Christ; in fact,
the image is that of San Juan Bautista or St. John the Baptist with the
Pascal lamb that symbolizes Jesus.&nbsp; It is for St. John, the namesake
of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista, that this mission has been called
the “Precursor’s mission,” as St. John’s ministry preceded that of Jesus
Christ.
<P>[Sidebar]
<BR><B>The Mission of Music and the Legacy of Father Esteban Tapis</B>
<P>Among the twenty-seven pastors who have thus far served Old Mission
San Juan Bautista, Father Esteban Tapis (1812-1825) is distinguished for
his contributions to the “Mission of Music.”&nbsp; Because he served for
a time as the Presidente of the California missions, and similarly taught
music and the liturgy in a number of these same missions, Father Tapis
brought his unique talents to Old Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Soon
after he arrived in 1812 he crafted the color-coded music hymnals or alabados
used by the Ohlone Mutsun choir of that time. The hymnals, which can still
be seen in the Old Mission museum, were crafted by hand and were rendered
in both Latin and Spanish.&nbsp; Many of the spiritual hymns recorded therein
are those that made up the core of the early California Roman Catholic
musical tradition.
<P>Father Tapis, who was buried under the main altar of the Old Mission
Church in 1825, spent his days teaching the gospel through music and through
newly acquired native dialects; he also served as the architect of the
main altar reredos and a number of the Old Mission’s more distinctive architectural
and artistic characteristics.
<P>Fray Esteban Tapis was born in the Villa de Santa Colona de Farnes in
the Diocese of Gerona within the Province of Cataluna, Spain, and spent
forty-eight of his sixty-nine years as a Franciscan, and thirty-eight of
those years in Alta California.&nbsp; During Father Tapis’ tenure at Old
Mission San Juan, he and Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta planned and
supervised a number of major construction projects critical to the completion
of the Old Mission and its outlying buildings and compounds.
<P>From the first year of his ministry at San Juan to his death on November
3rd of 1825, Fray Tapis oversaw several sizeable construction and renovation
projects, including the dedication of the main Church, the renovation and
expansion of the existing convento wing, the construction of much of that
area identified with “Neophyte” family housing, a lime kiln for firing
tiles and bricks, a fulling mill for the processing of wool, the construction
of adobe corrals for horses and sheep, and the reroofing and reflooring
of the granary, kiln, weaving rooms, and barracks buildings.&nbsp; Moreover,
through the thirteen years of his ministry at San Juan, Fray Tapis commissioned
or supervised the construction of more than seventy individual houses for
Mutsun Indian converts, in addition to the construction of a large dormitory
in 1815 for Mutsun widowers and single men.
<P>Fray Luis Gil noted Fr. Tapis’ passing in the 1825 burial registry with
these lasting words:
“he would write the music for the singers in the church, by
which means he endeavored to elevate the festivities and solemnities not
only among the Indians, but also among all others.&nbsp; In this way he
would see that they made their confessions on the major feasts.&nbsp; In
truth Fr. Tapis exercised his apostolic ministry to edify all.&nbsp; Hence
it is that he was blameless Religious, worthy of the highest praise, and
honor to this territory, and particularly to the College of San Fernando
de Mexico, to which he turned annually soliciting Religious to come and
labor in this vineyard of the Lord.”</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>The Baptistery</B>
<P>In addition to the painted carved wood and gesso-coated santos of the
main altar reredos, the baptismal font to the south or left side of the
main entrance to the church is original to the mission construction of
1812.&nbsp; Within and just outside the door of the baptistery are paintings
of St. John the Baptist included in the December of 1820 Informes inventory
of items acquired for the church by Fathers Esteban Tapis and Felipe Arroyo
de la Cuesta.&nbsp; Within the interior of the baptistery are included
the original hand-sculpted baptismal fonts carved by the early Mutsun sculptors
of San Juan.&nbsp; Carved in native sandstone, the two fonts are sculpted
in the style of those to be found in many a Mexican church and mission
and consist of two massive barrel-like sandstone basins.&nbsp; In this
ancient baptistery were baptized the several thousand native Mutsun and
early European colonists, residents, and parishioners who served, lived
and worked within the old community of San Juan Bautista and the ranchos
and rancherias of&nbsp; the Rio San Benito.
<P><B>The Stations of the Cross and the Paintings of the Apostles, ca.
1818</B>
<P>According to Reverend Zephyrin Engelhardt, “The church was enriched
with canvas pictures of the Via Crucis, and the main altar was built of
planed boards” in the year of 1818.&nbsp; The paintings depicting the Via
Crucis, or the fourteen “Stations of the Cross” and the Passion of Christ,
are among the most important furnishings of any of the Old California Catholic
missions, and the paintings of San Juan Bautista are among the finest.
<P>In the Via Crucis of Old Mission San Juan, the paintings are intended
to provide the pilgrim with a pictorial narrative of the events leading
up to the crucifixion of Christ.&nbsp; The paintings are each numbered
with Roman numerals (painted in dark red paint) and each painting is currently
positioned so as to allow the viewer to begin with the first of the paintings
nearest the altar -- positioned on the column immediately to the right
of the main altar or cemetery side of the Church.&nbsp; Proceeding from
the area nearest the altar, the visitor may view the first six paintings
depicting the Passion of Christ on the arcade to the left -- each occupies
the upper portion of&nbsp; one of each of the six columns on the northeast
or cemetary side of the Church -- and proceed to the back or entrance area
of the Church where the seventh and eighth Stations are located.&nbsp;
The last six paintings, depicting the Via Dolorosa or path to the Hill
of Skulls, continue from the column situated closest to the baptistery
on the left side of the Church, and end with the last station on the column
closest to the main altar on the left or garden side of the Church.&nbsp;
The final painting depicts the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Like
the large paintings of the Apostles that grace the walls of each of the
side aisles, the paintings of the Via Crucis retain their original handcarved
Mexican wood frames and bear the traces of two hundred years of exposure
to the elements and the smoke of burning votive candles.
<P>In addition to the richly-rendered canvases of the Via Crucis, the Old
Mission Church and Chapel contain many other paintings of the saints and
related images of importance to the Catholic church.&nbsp; One of the more
significant paintings of the Chapel is one that depicts St. John with the
Pascal Lamb.
<P>Finally, within the side-altar (devoted to the Child of Prague) on the
right or cemetary-side of the Church is to be found a painting of the Nativity
or birth of Christ, hung within the arcade archway closest to altar on
the right side of the Church.&nbsp; According to local lore, and personal
observation, when viewed from different angles and under varying lighting
conditions, the painting appears to change.&nbsp; Whereas the clouds above
the manger appear to form an image of the martyred Christ, the robes of
the people depicted -- and the animals illustrated therein -- appear to
take on the form of various creatures ranging from the face of a bear,
to that of an owl and a mountain lion...all animals original to local Mutsun
Indian lore and legend.
<P>Taken together, San Juan’s collection of Colonial period paintings represents
one of the artistic treasures of the California mission chain.&nbsp; In
addition to the artistic merit and preservation of these original works,
it is important to note that these paintings are original to the Old Mission
of San Juan Bautista, and a number of these paintings are documented from
various archival sources as having been brought to the mission in the period
before 1820.
<P><B>The “Cat” Door</B>
<P>&nbsp;The so-called “Cat Door” of the Old Mission Church has long held
the interest of the many visitors.&nbsp; The door in question may be seen
at the foot of the southeast door leading from the courtyard portico and
museum area into the main Church.&nbsp; The door itself measures about
nine inches wide by twelve inches in height.&nbsp; According to local lore,
the “Cat Door” was carved for the many cats that were maintained on the
mission grounds as a form of “pest control.”&nbsp; In the days before pest
control companies made available insecticides and rodent traps, the missionaries
were left to fend for themselves.&nbsp; Because the Old Mission is perched
above an agricultural field and former mission orchard, the presence of
field mice and other wild creatures was clearly a problem for the Old Mission
and its parish community.&nbsp; The cats, of course, made themselves indispensable
by virtue of keeping the rodents at a safe distance.&nbsp; The “Cat Door”
insured that the main Church remained free of the pesky rodents.
<P><B>The Chapel of 1799</B>
<P>One of the earliest of the three chapels constructed on the site of
the Old Mission is the Chapel of 1799.&nbsp; It stands immediately behind
the principal altar of the main Church, and can be reached by way of a
ramp leading from the Old Mission Garden into the chapel itself.&nbsp;
Though the chapel now boasts a single entry door and window facing on the
garden, and a similar window and door combination leading into the cemetery,
the chapel is entered by way of doors on both its south (or courtyard and
garden area) and north (cemetery area) sides.&nbsp; With the construction
of the main church, the Chapel of 1799 took on a secondary role and over
the years saw many uses including storage, a community hall, and later,
as a basketball court and thrift shop.&nbsp; In the end, an attempt was
made in the 1980’s to turn the former chapel into a museum area so as to
accommodate the sixteen by sixteen foot scale model of Old Mission San
Juan Bautista created by the inmates of the Atascadero State Mental Hospital.
<P><B>The Old Mission Courtyard</B>
<P>The courtyard and its garden, located at the heart of the original mission
quadrangle, was once the center of mission life.&nbsp; In addition to lying
adjacent to the chapel, main church, convento, and mission kitchen -- which
are the only surviving remains of the original mission quadrangle -- the
courtyard was flanked on the southwest by a long-narrow range structure
much like that of the existing convento wing.&nbsp; The Southwest Convento
was in its earliest days a clay-floored, tile-roofed, adobe structure which
fell into ruin some time around the 1830’s.&nbsp; Given the layout and
functions of many an early California mission settlement, it is likely
that the Southwest Convento wing served as a storage and workshop area,
while the courtyard itself served as an extended work and garden area.&nbsp;
In its heyday, the courtyard was the center for a variety of activities
ranging from the preparation of tallow candles to the tanning of leather;
carpentry, metal manufactory and related activities conducted in the former
rooms of the Mission’s workshop area.&nbsp; Because the missions were by
necessity self sufficient, many of the tools and furnishings of these colonial
settlements were crafted on site, and so it was that Franciscan padres,
Mission Indians, and itinerant Spanish and Mexican Indian craftsman invested
themselves in the work of forging tools, creating agricultural implements,
crafting furnishings, and erecting new adobe rooms.
<P><B>The Old Mission Cemetery</B>
<P>Located just outside the northeast wall of the Old Mission Church lies
the original campo santo or mission era cemetery.&nbsp; Perched at the
edge of the great San Andreas (St. Andrew) Fault, the Old Mission Cemetery
is said to contain the remains of some 4300 Mutsun natives and early European
colonists.&nbsp; At first glance, the visitor is hard-pressed to imagine
how it was possible to inter so many people in so small an area.&nbsp;
According to popular accounts and legends, the Indians were rolled into
blankets and buried one atop the other, and by this means it was possible
to accommodate so many of the dead.
<P>The cemetery, which contains the burials of several thousand, was in
fact partitioned into two separate burial areas.&nbsp; The area adjacent
to the main church was highly desired as a place of burial as this was
the ground that was blessed by the Bishop of Monterey at its dedication
in the early 1800’s.&nbsp; This was the Old Mission’s campo santo, and
as such, the main parcel of “holy ground” available to the mission community
of San Juan for the burial of its dead.&nbsp; As was the custom of the
day, Christians sought burial in grounds that had been blessed or consecrated
because these were thought to be the only acknowledged route to heaven
and full-fledged redemption in the kingdom of God.&nbsp; As a result, the
campo santo was in much demand by the families of the deceased.
<P><B>The Huerta or Old Mission Orchard of 1805</B>
<P>Today, a single pear tree from the Mission Orchard of 1805 stands as
a living testament to the diligence of the Mission Indian community and
the Franciscan padres who originally cultivated and transformed the region
of the Rio San Benito.&nbsp; The original orchard contained several hundred
fruit trees and grape vineyards and provided for the Old Mission’s communal
needs.&nbsp; According to an inventory conducted by Mexican Governor Pio
Pico in September of 1845, and published by Father Engelhardt, the huerta
or orchard of that time was described as “a garden to the north of the
parish building...[with]...875 fruit trees surrounded by a wall of old
cattle bones in good order, value...$875.”
<P>During the course of the 1930’s, the Old Mission Orchard was gradually
reduced to little more than a vacant field of grasses with a single ancient
pear tree to bear witness to its past as a mission orchard.&nbsp; By the
1950’s, the field was converted into a rodeo grounds complete with concrete
bleachers, fencing, and stairways.&nbsp; Though the rodeos were quite popular
in their day, and attracted people from throughout California and the Southwest,
including many a celebrity, the rodeo was eventually abandoned.
<P><B>Expansion and Decline</B>
<P>The 19th Century saw the rapid expansion and the equally rapid decline
of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; While the mission prospered
through the first two decades of the 19th Century, the Mexican Independence
movement of 1810 to 1824 indirectly undermined the development of the missions
of Alta California.&nbsp; With supplies and resources at a premium, and
the escalation of the Independence movement gaining momentum in Mexico,
the mission communities were faced with mounting pressures to contribute
church resources to the maintenance of Spain’s presidios, garrisons, and
provincial administrators.&nbsp; The ultimate blow came with the Californio-borne
movement to privatize mission holdings by way of the Secularization Decree
of 1832.
<P><B>Mission Secularization and the Mexican Era</B>
<P>While the founding of the twenty-one mission communities of Alta California
spanned a period of some fifty-four years, the Mexican period spanned only
twenty-two years; nevertheless, this era marked one of the most dynamic,
and at the same time, catastrophic periods for early California mission
history.&nbsp; In 1822, insurgents led by Agustin de Iturbide overthrew
the Viceroyalty of New Spain and subsequently declared the establishment
of the Mexican Republic in 1824; thereby ending three centuries of Spanish
colonial domination in the New World.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, the new government
of Mexico sought to expel all Spaniards from the Mexican Republic lest
they swear allegiance to the fledgling government.&nbsp; In addition, anti-clerical
sentiment in Mexico sought to stem the power and influence of the Catholic
church, and soon, the holdings of the old mission communities of Alta California
were targeted for expropriation and privatization.
<P>These facts posed considerable complications for the California missions
and missionaries as many of the early Padres were of Spanish origin and
the lands and holdings in question were made quite vulnerable.&nbsp; At
the time of this order, padre Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta was too ill to
fend off the attacks on the Old Mission’s holdings, and ultimately, it
was left to the newly assigned Zacatecan friars of Mexico to make way for
the many changes that would beset the old missions through the first half
of the 19th Century.
<P>While the first thirty-three years of the 19th Century proved most productive
to the development of Old Mission San Juan, the period from 1833 through
1840 proved its worst.&nbsp; In the few years immediately following the
secularization of Old Mission San Juan, the Mutsune, Tulareno and Yokut
Indian inhabitants had all but abandoned their former homes and holdings
in the area of the Rio San Benito.&nbsp; Mexican government officials and
colonists rapidly moved onto what formerly constituted the Old Mission’s
holdings and properties and the Mutsune Indian community was left to fend
off the new interlopers.
<P>In the Informes report of 1840, the Reverend Antonio Anzar speaks bitterly
of the destruction of the mission and its holdings, and of the dispersal
of the native Mutsune population.&nbsp; Reverend Anzar similarly notes
that troubles between the new colonists and the Tulareno Indians resulted
in a number of tragic and bloody raids and retaliations. At this same time,
Governor Pio Pico and General Castro were at work accounting for and freely
distributing the last of the Old Mission’s formerly vast holdings to Mexican
grantees.&nbsp; In addition, Tiburcio Castro, the Mexican period mayordomo
or “manager” of mission properties during the Secularization era, attempted
to have San Juan Bautista renamed San Juan de Castro.&nbsp; Despite his
best efforts, the community was for many years simply called San Juan.&nbsp;
The name San Juan Bautista was not reintroduced until after 1905.&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to local historian Charles Clough, by 1845 “all mission property
was put on sale, except the mission chapel, the curate’s home and the land
immediately around it.”&nbsp; So it was that from the Secularization of
1832 until the return of the Mission’s holdings by the United States government
in 1855, the Old Mission was reduced in size and importance, and with the
exception of the main church and existing convento wing, many of its original
buildings were confiscated, burned and or allowed to fall into ruin.
<P><B>Rancheros, Californios, and the Transformation of San Juan</B>
<P>The period of the 1830’s and 1840’s was a time of major change for Alta
California and the region of the Rio San Benito in particular.&nbsp; In
those days, many a large-landed estate or rancho appeared on the landscape.&nbsp;
The original properties of the California mission communities were soon
parceled out -- by virtue of Mexican land grants -- to many of the 800
or so Californio families of Alta California.&nbsp; As a result, many of
these families built upon former mission holdings, or from family wealth
accrued by virtue of Spanish land grants, in the prosperous and extravagant
Mexican Ranchero period of early California history.
<P>At San Juan Bautista, the Californios quickly transformed the social
and cultural life of the community.&nbsp; In the Old Plaza, bull and grizzly
bear fights, hosted by Mexican vaqueros or “cowboys,” were a regular occurrence.&nbsp;
Grizzly bears, some towering over ten to twelve feet in height, were captured
by skilled vaqueros using rope and lasso.&nbsp; Once captured, the grizzly
was tethered to a post or a tree in the area of the Old Plaza, and bulls
and mountain lions were sent in to fight these awesome creatures.&nbsp;
In addition to the bull and bear fights, vaqueros demonstrated their skills
at bull-fighting, riding, and related events.
<P>Social life among the Californios included elaborate fandangos or Spanish
and Mexican styled dances in elaborate costumes.&nbsp; The upper floors
of some of the Mexican or Ranchero period adobe estates of San Juan and
vicinity were often constructed for the expressed purpose of using these
as dance areas for the fandangos.&nbsp; Many such events culminated in
elaborate parties and matanzas during which many head of cattle were slaughtered
for meat.&nbsp; During this period, many of the old two-storied adobes
of San Juan Bautista -- and Monterey -- were constructed; and so was borne
the “Monterey style” of adobe architecture in California.
<P>On another front, the Ranchero era was not without its political troubles.&nbsp;
The isolation and helplessness felt by Californios toward the “centralist”
and all powerful government of President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna rapidly
escalated to conflict in Alta California and Texas.&nbsp; As a result,
on November 7th of 1836 the Californio legislature announced that: “Alta
California declares itself independent of Mexico until the federal system
adopted in 1824 is reestablished.”&nbsp; At about the same time, and for
many of the same reasons, Texas declared itself in revolt.
<BR>The discontent felt by many a Californio toward the Mexican government
of President Santa Anna soon translated into calls for the independence
of Alta California.&nbsp; As a direct result of longstanding conflicts
between representatives of the government of Mexico and that of Alta California,
the fledgling independence movement in Alta California made possible the
subsequent U.S. invasion and occupation of the area.&nbsp; Civil unrest
in Mexico City and within the government of Alta California only hastened
the collapse of the era of the Californios and their vast landholdings.&nbsp;
In the end, American troops either found themselves fighting pitched and
bloody battles against Californio&nbsp; cavalrymen – replete with superbly
trained “lancers,” or welcomed with apathy or ambivalence by those who
yearned for independence from Mexico and the control of President Santa
Anna.
<P>On the eve of the American invasion of Upper California, a contingent
of Army Corp of Topographical Engineers under the direction of John Fremont
traversed the San Benito Valley via Pacheco Pass and San Juan en route
to the Salinas Valley and the Monterey Bay.&nbsp; In the winter of 1845,
as an act of defiance, Fremont raised the American flag on Gabilan Peak
after being ordered out of the territory by the Mexican government.&nbsp;
After three days, Fremont was forced to retreat to the north by Mexican
troops under the command of General Jose Castro.&nbsp; General Jose Castro,
the commander of the Northern Forces of the Mexican Army, and acting governor
or prefect of Alta California for a time, used San Juan as his home, and
the Castro-Breen Adobe as his headquarters for the northern campaign against
the American invasion.
<P>Soon thereafter, the United States declared war on Mexico, and the resulting
conflict saw the invasion and occupation of Veracruz and Mexico City by
American troops.&nbsp; Despite General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna’s best
efforts to stave off the American invasion, Mexico was soon defeated and
her fate thrown into question.&nbsp; Though the U.S. Congress debated the
legality of the invasion during the course of the war, Mexico ultimately
conceded defeat and began negotiating the terms of surrender.&nbsp; As
a result, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo was drafted and the Mexican Republic
was soon divested of virtually all of its holdings north of the Rio Grande.&nbsp;
By February 2nd of 1848, the treaty was ratified by both nations and the
Mexican Cession resulted in the transfer of Alta California, and the New
Mexican and Texan territories.&nbsp; Today, this vast area contains all
or portions of the American states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah,
Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.&nbsp; Within a year of the signing of
the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the California gold rush of 1849 saw a
massive influx of American and Sonoran miners and businessman.&nbsp; By
1850, California was granted statehood, and from that point onward, the
Old Mission and community of San Juan Bautista has been governed by the
United States.
<P>By 1859, President James Buchannon approved legislation mandating the
return of some 55 acres of former mission lands to the parish of San Juan
and the Diocese of Monterey by the U.S. government.&nbsp; This gesture
provided the first indication by the American government that mission holdings
were off limits to privatization and squatters.&nbsp; The heated debates
in congress that anticipated the return of portions of the formerly vast
holdings of the California mission communities was largely seen as an attempt
to further communicate American discontent with the former Mexican governance
of the province in question.
<P>Soon thereafter, American survey crews began mapping the San Juan Valley
in an effort to document land grant holdings as well as public and private
property boundaries.&nbsp; Several such maps can be seen within the collections
of the Old Mission Museum’s archives and displays.&nbsp; Of the thirteen
major land grant properties lying within the present-day boundaries of
San Benito County, the largest was that of Rancho Santa Ana y Quien Sabe
(48,822.60 acres) and the smallest such grant was that of the San Antonio
(4,493 acres).&nbsp; Whereas the former grant of April 8th, 1839 was held
jointly by Don Manuel Larios and Juan M. Anzar (Reverend Antonio Anzar’s
brother), the latter was held exclusively by Don Manuel Larios.&nbsp; Other
early land grantees included Francisco Pacheco, Antonio Chavez, Angel Castro,
Jose Maria Sanchez, Jose A. Castro, Francisco Aria, Saturnino Carriaga,
Cruz Cervantes, Rafael Gonzales, Rafael Sanchez, and Joaquin Gomez.&nbsp;
All told, these thirteen grantees or rancheros held Mexican and Spanish
land grants totaling some 314,785.74 acres; some portions of which extended
well beyond the boundaries of present-day San Benito County.
<P><B>Colonel Hollister and the Railroad</B>
<P>Though San Juan vied for the attention of the railroad in 1871, the
Southern Pacific Railroad was ultimately routed through the upstart community
of Hollister.&nbsp; As a result, San Juan declined while Hollister rapidly
grew into the new economic and social center of the region.&nbsp; According
to Marjorie Pierce, “While Hollister was hoisting its flag, over at San
Juan theirs was at half-mast, at least figuratively.&nbsp; This was the
death knell for the mission town, as far as progress was concerned.”&nbsp;
San Juan was as a result virtually depopulated by the lure of the railroad.&nbsp;
Soon thereafter, Hollister could boast a city population of some 2,000
persons, whereas San Juan Bautista was left with fewer than two hundred
residents and many abandoned businesses.&nbsp; In those days, the town’s
streets were overgrown with weeds and grasses and cattle were allowed to
run freely up and down main street.&nbsp; Roving cattle very likely helped
keep the vegetation from completely obscuring the streets of San Juan Bautista
in that difficult day and age.&nbsp; In the mean time, many of the town’s
most ancient adobe buildings crumbled to the ground, while others, like
Old Mission San Juan underwent episodes of abject neglect punctuated by
periods of major construction and renovation.&nbsp; While the pages of
history provide little in the way of information regarding mission life
in the period from 1840 through 1865, the arrival of Father Cipriano Rubio
from New England marked a new era in mission restoration and renovation.
<P>Not until Father Cipriano Rubio’s 1874 modifications and renovations
do we receive any accounting of efforts to enhance or restore the existing
buildings of Old Mission San Juan.&nbsp; Ironically, while Father Rubio
is credited with the construction of the mission’s only tower-like belfry
in 1874, the original torreon or “guard tower” that once stood at the end
of the existing convento wing appears to have fallen into ruin or to have
been dismantled in the period between 1852 and 1870.
<P>&nbsp;[Vertigo Sidebar]
<BR><B>Father Rubio’s Victorian Belltower</B>
<P>In the area immediately above the baptistery is a room adjacent to the
ancient choir loft situated over the main entrance to the church.&nbsp;
This second floor room once served as the summit of a massive adobe staircase
to the choir loft constructed in the early 19th Century, and removed after
the earthquake of 1906.&nbsp; Today, this room leads to a doorway that
extends into an adjacent room that remains unrestored, and which includes
adobe walls and flooring, ancient construction debris, and chalk graffiti
dating to the period just after the earthquake of 1906.&nbsp; In this location
there exists an arch-shaped Colonial era window that once faced onto the
courtyard when the baptistery and its second floor room and tower originally
fronted courtyard prior to the expansion of the convento wing.&nbsp; Today,
the old window is located beneath the center of the tiled roof of the Old
Convento.
<P>In 1874, Reverend Cipriano Rubio (1865-1875) commissioned San Juan merchant
and carpenter, Steve Lavagnino, to construct a New England-styled wooden
bell tower and steeple in the area immediately adjacent to the baptistery
room on the plaza side of the Old Mission Church.
<P>According to the San Benito Advance of September 5, 1874, “The belfry
of the old mission church was completed on Easter Monday and it gives quite
an ornamental appearance to the plaza...For architectural design and finish
it cannot be excelled.”&nbsp; At that time, Father Rubio used the area
immediately above and adjacent to the baptistery room, and underneath the
bells of the bell tower, as his personal apartment.&nbsp; According to
local lore, Father Rubio hung the ropes to the bells within the bell tower
in the area just above his bedroom.&nbsp; It is said that this was done
so as to allow Father Rubio the convenience of being able to toll the ancient
Mexican bells of Old Mission San Juan without having to leave the comfort
of his bed.
<P>On April 2nd of 1897, the San Benito Advance reported that Father Cipriano
Rubio’s successor, the Reverend Valentin Closa (1875-1909), “has had the
conical tower taken down from the mission church.&nbsp; It was entirely
out of keeping with the ancient edifice.&nbsp; When the improvement is
complete it will be as it was originally and in keeping with the rest of
the edifice.”&nbsp; By that date, the bell tower and its steeply pitched
steeple had suffered extensive damage as the result of area storms.&nbsp;
The clapboard-covered bell tower shaft itself, however, was spared and
was subsequently resurfaced with stucco and covered with a Mission-styled
dome that remained until the tower was finally dismantled in its entirety
in 1949.&nbsp; Ironically, the tower was removed prior to the beginning
of production on Alfred Hitchcock’s motion picture Vertigo in 1953.&nbsp;
As it turns out, the Victorian bell tower was written into Alfred Hitchcock’s
script as a critically important scene in which Jimmy Stewart suffers a
bout with...; yes, you guessed it, vertigo!&nbsp; Unfortunately, Alfred
Hitchcock was then unaware that the bell tower had been dismantled prior
to the scheduled arrival of his film crews and actors in the community
of San Juan Bautista.

<P><B>&nbsp;Chapter III: The 20th Century: A New Life</B></CENTER>

<P>The story of the Old Mission in the 20th Century is primarily defined
by the earthquake of 1906 and the many efforts made to restore and repair
the damage sustained by the Old Mission during that fateful year.&nbsp;
Nearly seventy years would pass before the Old Mission Church would be
fully restored to its original 19th Century appearance.
<P><B>The Great Earthquake of 1906</B>
<P>The earthquake that devastated the city of San Francisco in 1906 also
visited its wrath on the ancient buildings of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp;
In that year, an unusually heavy rainy season left the soils about the
mission saturated.&nbsp; As a result, the north and south walls of the
main church sustained water damage that so weakened the massive walls that
the 1906 quake easily tumbled them to the ground.&nbsp; In addition, the
earthquake caused the collapse of the south end of the convento wing.
<P>The photographic record makes clear the extent of the damage; particularly
that damage that nearly resulted in loss of life when one of the walls
of the late 19th Century orphanage formerly located in the area of the
new rectory buildings came tumbling down.&nbsp; Luckily, none of the orphans
or their caretakers were harmed in the devastation of the day.&nbsp; In
the end, Father Valentine Closa was forced to close the orphanage and move
services to the Old Convento sala, wherein the Mission Model of Atascadero
is now stored.
<P><B>La Gran Fiesta de San Juan</B>
<P>In tracing the initial efforts that ultimately culminated with the major
restoration efforts that preceded San Juan’s celebration of the American
bicentennial in 1976; we must turn to the period shortly after the earthquake
of 1906.&nbsp; In that year, Father Valentine Closa appealed to the parish
community of San Juan, and his call for help quickly spread far and wide.&nbsp;
By 1907, the community organized the beginnings of what has become an annual
fund-raising drive and Fiesta specifically intended to benefit the restoration
and maintenance of the Old Mission.&nbsp; San Juan residents soon organized
the first Rodeo and annual Fiesta which celebrated the Old Mission’s heritage
and history, and also promoted its preservation.&nbsp; The first Fiesta
was staged on Saint John’s Day -- June 24th -- of 1907.
<P>This first event marked the replacement and rededication of a thirty
foot tall redwood cross on Mt. Holy Cross, also known as “Pagan Hill”,
and a celebration that included a horse-drawn carriage parade within the
main plaza fronting the Old Mission.
<P>Many a San Juan Fiesta and Pageant of the 1920’s and 1930’s attracted
noted celebrities; including then Governor Merriam, Lt. Governor Hatfield,
San Francisco Mayor Rossi, child star Jane Withers, actress Sally Blaine
and her husband movie director Norman Foster, and actresses and actors
including Jimmy “James” Gleason and Lucille Gleason, Tom Brown, and Neil
Hamilton.
<P>Over the years, the Pageants and Fiestas provided the funds for many
restoration efforts; however, the greatest damage to the Old Mission was
well beyond even the San Juan community’s means.&nbsp; A number of Father
Closa’s notes and letters speak to the high cost of repairing and maintaining
those portions of the Old Mission damaged in the 1906 earthquake, and as
late at the 1950’s, Father Sullivan wrote of the high cost of “expert”
advice that asserted the restoration of the Old Mission Church was not
feasible, and it would be in the best interests of the parish to see the
entire mission church and convento razed and replaced with a new building
fashioned of steel I-beams and concrete.&nbsp; As a result of the questionable
nature of this plan, and the nearly one-million dollar price tag projected
for a complete reconstruction, a potential benefactor, who had originally
pledged over $250,000, immediately withdrew his support.
<P><B>Mission Restoration</B>
<P>In the 1930’s, the residents of the community of San Juan Bautista,
with the assistance of crews from the Works Progress Administration, the
Depression era program which both restored and erected countless public
buildings of great artistic and historic significance, undertook a number
of major renovations and additions at the Old Mission.&nbsp; At this time,
a new “poured concrete” rectory building was constructed, the Victorian
bell-tower was renovated, the church and convento were mapped, and the
adobe wall encircling the mission courtyard and adjacent properties was
constructed.
<P>Efforts at restoration were renewed in the 1950’s, and fortunately the
“expert” advice given to Father Sullivan was ignored.&nbsp; Volunteers
and work crews set about the task of&nbsp; working to restore the original
mission buildings, with a number of the Victorian period additions removed,
bringing the mission closer to its original appearance.&nbsp; Among other
changes, the wooden clapboard that had been nailed to the ceiling of the
main church, and the Victorian bell tower were both removed.&nbsp; The
Victorian bell tower, which had been modified in the 1930’s with a stucco
facing and a tiled roof so as to conform with the overall style of the
mission buildings, was finally dismantled in 1949.
<P><B>The Mission Model of Atascadero</B>
<P>In 1950, the new hospital for the criminally insane was completed at
Atascadero, California, and soon thereafter, the counselors, therapists
and doctors of the Atascadero State Mental Hospital began the task of working
toward the rehabilitation of those inmates who could be helped.&nbsp; One
of the new therapists at Atascadero was Mr. Al Vercoutere, whose efforts
to provide guidance and therapy for the inmates centered on his efforts
to engage his charges with the task of taking on the work of history and
model-making. In 1953, he and a group of inmates under his care began work
on a most ambitious project; that being, the construction of a scale model
reproduction of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; They began
with a floor-plan obtained through the Smithsonian Institution, and their
diligent efforts continued for well over one year.
<P>In addition to a scale model that included all existing 1950’s era adobe
structures of the Old Mission, his team also included the Southwest and
Northwest Convento wings that originally served to enclose a courtyard,
and thereby, recreated the appearance of the Old Mission Quadrangle.&nbsp;
This team also took great care to make scale model doors, windows, picture
frames, and an altar screen in wood, with all walls covered in plaster
over canvas.&nbsp; The roof tiles were in turn fired from half-inch thick
slabs of textured adobe clay originally obtained on site at Old Mission
San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; They also chose to exclude any non-original and
non-Colonial-era features, thereby excluding the Victorian period bell
tower that once graced the south half of the church’s main entrance from
about 1870 until 1949.
<P>In the end, the Atascadero model grew to cover a platform measuring
over sixteen by sixteen feet; and as such, this model -- created by the
inmates of the Atascadero State Hospital -- continues to hold sway as the
largest California mission model.
<P><B>The American Bicentennial</B>
<P>In preparation for its celebration of the American Bicentennial on July
4th of 1976, the Old Mission began well in advance with restorations of
the main church and side-aisles damaged in 1906.
<P>In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, the community of San Juan -- particularly
the San Juan Historical Society and the Fiesta Committee -- intensified
their fundraising efforts.&nbsp; And the impending American Bicentennial
celebration added greatly to the interest and support for completing the
restoration.&nbsp; The result was nearly the one-million dollars required
for a full-fledged restoration.
<P>In 1974, the arduous task of planning and implementing the reconstruction
of the Church side-aisles began in earnest.&nbsp; The principal architect
of the plan was Sir Harry Downey, a master craftsmen and veteran of previous
mission restorations, who had already undertaken and completed the full-fledged
restoration of Mission San Carlos de Borromeo in Carmel, sponsored by the
Hearst Foundation.
<P>Local workmen were recruited to recreate the thousands upon thousands
of adobe bricks required for the restoration of the massive side-aisles.&nbsp;
In addition, because many of the original timbers used to roof the side-aisles
were destroyed in the earthquake of 1906, workers were also recruited to
rebuild and restore the roof and ceiling of the side-aisles.&nbsp; In this
effort, workers were put to the task of using primitive adzes and axes
in an effort to reproduce the rough-hewn appearance of the remaining original
roofing members.
<P>Because the restoration demanded that the original archways be reopened,
it was necessary to retrofit the side aisles for protection against continuing
seismic activity, particularly important as the Old Mission sits adjacent
to the San Andreas fault.&nbsp; To this end, the State of California demanded
that all adobes be tested, and that steel cabling be used in the flooring
so as to anchor walls and archways.&nbsp; Though the workmen used cement
mixers to create the mixture of clay, hay and manure required to produce
durable, State inspected and approved and seismically stable adobe bricks,
every other step in the adobe brick manufacturing process followed those
procedures used in the Spanish colonial era.
<P>Reopening the sealed archways of the main church required the removal
of tons of adobe bricks installed some time after 1812 under the orders
of either padre Esteban Tapis or Father Arroyo de la Cuesta.&nbsp; This
removal of the adobe bricks from the archways revealed fragments of paint
and portions of the original painted decorations of the main church.
<P>With the north and south walls of the main church rebuilt, the side-aisle
archways reopened, and the floors and ceilings restored, the repainting
of the main church was left to architectural historian Norman Neuerburg.&nbsp;
Given the fragility of those mural fragments recovered within the archways,
it was not possible to conserve the surviving portions of the original
mission decor.&nbsp; As such, Neuerburg proceeded with the decoration of
the main church based on the designs of the main altar reredos and the
recovered mural fragments in the newly unsealed archways.
<P>As part of this overall effort Harry Downey directed the construction
of a campanario or bell cote for the bronze bells of Mission San Juan.&nbsp;
Though the Old Mission did not originally boast a campanario, he believed
the Franciscan Padres had originally intended a bell tower, and the construction
was modeled on the campanile of the Old Mission of San Diego de Alcala
-- the first of the mission churches of Alta California.&nbsp; Although
San Juan is thought to have originally had a grouping of nine bronze church
bells, only three of the original bells remain at Old Mission San Juan.&nbsp;
These bells, the side aisles, and the whole of the Old Mission of San Juan
Bautista, after decades of devotion and effort, were now ready to celebrate
the 1976 American Bicentennial.

<P><B>Chapter IV: Mission San Juan Bautista Today</B></CENTER>

<P>Originally founded as a Franciscan mission community on June 24th of
1797, San Juan Bautista is today one of seven early California missions
within the Diocese of Monterey.&nbsp; As an active parish within the larger
spiritual community of the Diocese of Monterey -- which currently includes
a total of forty-six parish churches, the Old Mission has served under
the direction of the Diocese since it was first created by the Holy See
on April 27, 1840.
<P><B>Diocesan Fathers</B>
<P>During the Spanish colonial and Mexican periods, and prior to the creation
of the Diocese of Monterey, the Franciscan Padres of Old Mission San Juan
were under the immediate jurisdiction of the Obispado de Monterey – or
Bishopric of Monterey -- which reported to the Archbishop and the Franciscan
superiors at the Apostolic College of San Fernando, Mexico.
<P>The Diocese of Both Californias was originally established in 1840 with
Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno as bishop.&nbsp; In 1849, the Diocese was
renamed the Diocese of Monterey and the bishop of that time was Joseph
Alemany.&nbsp; Though it underwent many changes over the years, including
mergers with Los Angeles and Fresno, the Diocese of Monterey was re-established
in 1967 and currently includes the Central Coast counties of Monterey,
San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, and San Benito.&nbsp; While its first bishop
was named in 1840, the fifth and current bishop of the Diocese of Monterey
is Bishop Sylvester Ryan.
<P>Since its founding, Old Mission San Juan has been blessed with the contributions
of many clerics and Religious, including the Franciscans of the Apostolic
College of San Fernando (Mexico), the Zacatecan Franciscans of the Secularization
era, the Maryknoll Fathers, the Sisters of the Atonement, and the Diocesan
Fathers and parish pastors of today.
<P>Today, the Diocese includes the historically and spiritually significant
early California&nbsp; missions and chapels of San Carlos de Borromeo (Carmel
Mission Basilica), Mission San Antonio de Padua (Jolon), Old Mission San
Luis Obispo, Old Mission San Miguel Arcangel, Mission Santa Cruz (Holy
Cross), Nuestra Senora de la Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude), and the Royal
Presidio Chapel of&nbsp; San Carlos Borromeo de Monterey.
<P><B>San Antonio’s Halo</B>
<P>San Antonio or Saint Anthony is cherished in the Catholic community
as the patron of the poor and of lost objects, and ironically, for Old
Mission San Juan Bautista, even San Antonio is not immune to loss.&nbsp;
Throughout the course of the 19th Century, the four foot statue of San
Antonio -- that today stands in the upper left-hand corner of the main
altar of the Old Mission’s Church -- has presided over events both great
and small.&nbsp; Having survived largely unscathed for nearly a century,
the events of the great earthquake of 1906 were to change San Antonio’s
angelic appearance.&nbsp; As the result of the earthquake that brought
down the side-aisles of the main Church, the santos were removed from the
main altar out of fear that aftershocks might bring down the massive church.
<P>At this time, services were shifted to the convento wing -- now the
Old Mission Museum -- and a temporary altar was set up in what had formerly
constituted the two rooms adjacent the sala or “Room of the Four Chimneys.”&nbsp;
Photographs of the time clearly show San Antonio and the other saints of
the main altar in new locations on the floor of one of the rooms of the
convento.&nbsp; In one such photo, the ornately crafted silver halo of
San Antonio is clearly evident; that however, would be the last time the
saint would bear his halo in public for a period of nearly eighty-nine
years.
<P>As fate would have it, the story of San Antonio’s halo would find new
life in October of 1995, when the parish office received a phone call from
a family recently relocated to the community of Salinas, California.&nbsp;
On that occasion, the parish office was informed that the family wished
to donate a silver candle-stick to the Old Mission.&nbsp; According to
the donors, the candle-stick had been acquired at a local swap meet, and
not long after the purchase, the family moved to Saint Louis, Missouri.&nbsp;
After fifteen years, the family packed up its belongings, and the silver
candle-stick, and returned to Salinas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the fact that
the candle-stick bore the inscribed name of “San Juan Bautista,” the family
decided that it would be appropriate to donate the candle-stick to Old
Mission San Juan Bautista.
<P>Shortly after receiving the candle-stick, the parish priest contacted
curator Sir Richard Menn so as to have the artifact cleaned and restored.&nbsp;
Though slightly damaged, the silver artifact was in remarkably good condition,
particularly given its age and the circuitous odyssey that saw it back
to San Juan.&nbsp; Upon completing the restoration of the so-called “candle-stick”,
suspicions emerged over the rather imposing spike (with the rectangular
cross-section) dominating the center of the so-called “candle-stick.”&nbsp;
In the ensuing days and weeks, the parish priest began searching the mission’s
photo archives for evidence pointing to the original use of the silver
artifact.&nbsp; After some searching, the parish priest had his answer,
and in October of 1995, he climbed the ancient redwood staircase that serves
the altar screen of the main church and soon received confirmation of his
suspicions.&nbsp; Upon peering into the top of the sculpted wooden head
of San Antonio, the pastor found a hole with a rectangular cross-section
that appeared to match the fit of the spike on the so-called “candle-stick;”
so on a Sunday morning mass in October 1995, the pastor announced to his
parish that they were about to experience a little bit of history.&nbsp;
Climbing the staircase of the altar screen, the assembled congregation
anxiously awaited the historical revelation in question, and soon the parish
priest appeared within the niche that holds the statue of San Antonio.&nbsp;
And so it was that the patron of the poor and of lost objects was again
crowned with the silver “halo” that mysteriously disappeared shortly after
the cataclysmic events of 1906.
<P><B>The Mission’s Bicentennial Celebration</B>
<P>For the mission and community of San Juan Bautista, the Old Mission’s
bicentennial celebration of June 24th, 1997 was a much anticipated social
and historical event.&nbsp; For the parish community of San Juan, the celebration
presented itself as an opportunity to reaffirm one’s faith in the continuity
of church tradition; while for the visitor, the celebration was an opportunity
to partake of food and game booths, and share in the excitement and nostalgia
of the moment.&nbsp; More importantly, the coordination and planning of
the event was truly a community-wide event that required the volunteer
contributions of both residents and non-residents alike.
<P>Perhaps one of the most notable events of the Old Mission’s bicentennial
celebration included a parish pilgrimage to Spain and the birthplace of
San Juan’s founding father, Padre Fermin Francisco de Lasuen.&nbsp; While
on the one hand, the weekend of June 22nd, 1997 saw the unveiling of a
bronze bust of Father Lasuen donated to the Old Mission by the people of
Spain; at the other end of the spectrum, an Old Timer’s Parade and Elvis
impersonator drew large crowds of onlookers.&nbsp; And, as was the case
nearly a century ago with the Old Mission’s centennial celebration, souvenirs
of every imaginable kind were sold by local merchants and Fiesta vendors.&nbsp;
The Old Mission in turn commissioned the minting of a commemorative silver
medallion for the 200th anniversary of the founding of San Juan Bautista.
<P><B>Visiting the Old Mission</B>
<P>While visiting Old Mission San Juan Bautista you should plan to accommodate
tours of the main Church, the Chapel of 1799, the Old Mission Cemetery
and Well, the courtyard gardens, and the rooms and exhibits within the
Old Mission Museum.&nbsp; Please note that the Old Mission Kitchen and
Archives Room are visible only from the arcade walkway that fronts the
courtyard gardens.&nbsp; You should in addition plan to tour the El Camino
Real and the Earthquake Walk of the great San Andreas Fault that lies adjacent
the Old Mission Cemetery.
<P>While viewing the gardens, you will note the presence of a small sandstone
pillar of Romanesque design located in an open courtyard area of the garden.&nbsp;
This is the original Mission sundial or “timepiece” once used to mark the
passage of the hours.&nbsp; Though it may not always account for daylight
savings time, you may notice that the shadow cast by the metal fin atop
the pedestal provides a relatively good indicator of the passage of time.
<P>You should note that the Old Mission and museum is open to the public
daily, with the exception of Thanksgiving, December 25th, and January 1st,
and in the weeks before Christmas day, the world renowned Teatro Campesino
performs one of two colorful evening plays in the main church.&nbsp; These
elaborate renditions of traditional Mexican folk performance include either
La Pastorela, or La Virgen de Tepeyac.&nbsp; These performances lend themselves
to the spiritual and historic atmosphere of the Old Mission and community.
<P><B>The Old Mission Museum and Its Displays</B>
<P>At present, the Old Mission Museum is reached via the Gift Shop entrance
located in the arcade fronting the Old Plaza.&nbsp; Because the Old Mission
relies on contributions to maintain its museum, gardens, and historical
collections, your donations are encouraged and appreciated.
<P>While much of the Old Mission’s finer pieces of art are to be seen in
the main church and chapel, the museum provides a glimpse into the craftsmanship,
culture, technology, and history of yesteryear.&nbsp; In addition to its
fine collection of silk vestments -- including chasubles, brocades, copes,
and other items, the museum contains an important collection of beautifully
crafted 18th, 19th, and early 20th Century statuary, woodcraft and metalwork’s,
porcelain figures, musical instruments, Mutsune Indian basketry and mortars,
hand-painted retablos, hymnals, and other religious articles, and period
furnishings.&nbsp; In addition, the visitor may see for themselves the
original personal library collections of padres’ Tapis and Arroyo de la
Cuesta.&nbsp; Many of the hand-bound leather books within the collection
contain the personal notes of both Fathers’ Tapis and Arroyo de la Cuesta,
and date to as early as the 17th Century.
<P>Within the room adjacent to the Sala or “Room of the Four Chimneys”
will be seen the Mission Model of Atascadero.&nbsp; The relative size and
great detail of the model serves to inspire many a children’s grade school
“mission model” project.&nbsp; Today, the mission model occupies much of
the floor space of a room that was once converted for use as a temporary
chapel after the earthquake of 1906.
<P>In the Old Mission Kitchen and dining areas you will note the presence
of a number of furnishings and utensils original to the early Mission.&nbsp;
The chairs and related furnishings of the dining area date to the 18th
and early 19th centuries and have served as models for the reproduction
of other such furnishings at the missions of La Purisima Concepcion and
Carmel.&nbsp; On the floor of the kitchen, you will note the presence of
Mexican grinding slabs or metates -- for the preparation of maize -- sitting
side by side with Mutsune Indian ground-stone mortars for the grinding
of acorns and other wild seeds.&nbsp; Hanging from the massive crossbeam
that supports the adobe smoke flume of the old kitchen’s cooking area,
you will notice a variety of metal tools; including two pairs of metal
tongs used for the baking of the Host used in administering holy communion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each of these bears an image of the crucified Christ; and on each is inscribed
their respective origins -- Peru and Mexico.
<P><B>Restoration: The Living Museum</B>
<P>Old Mission San Juan Bautista is a living tradition, and as the service
of the Old Mission continues and grows, so to does our knowledge of its
past. Because of the importance of preserving its significant historical
collections, documents, and other artifacts – including, the original works
and libraries of Fathers Arroyo de la Cuesta and Esteban Tapis, 18th and
19th Century furnishings and art, Mutsun Indian basketry and related Mission
period items – the Old Mission and Museum will see much change in the years
to come.
<P>Through the methods of archaeology, museum curation, historic preservation,
and architectural reconstruction, the Old Mission has undertaken an important
program of archaeological and historical studies, renovations, and restorations
intended to enhance and build upon the historical and educational integrity
of this most historic of California mission communities.&nbsp; The parish
and its community partners – including, the Friends of the Mission, CSU
Monterey Bay, the Gabilan Conservation Camp, El Teatro Campesino, and local
contributors and other Mission benefactors -- are currently working to
rebuild and restore the original gardens, quadrangle, convento buildings,
courtyard, and tower that once dominated life at the center of the Old
Mission community.
<P>Recent contributions have resulted in the restoration of the Chapel
of 1799, the excavation and reconstruction of the Old Mission Well, the
reopening of the original salas or “living” and reading rooms of the convento
wing, the partial renovation, curation, and inventory of artifacts and
display areas within the Old Mission Museum, and the beginnings of a larger
effort to restore the gardens in and about the original mission compound.
<P>Drawing on what we have learned from recent archaeological excavations,
surveys, mappings, and historical studies, the quadrangle and its two “missing”
convento wings will be reconstructed atop their original foundations.&nbsp;
The silt stone foundations of the original buildings, which fell into ruin
by the 1830’s and were rediscovered by way of recent archaeological excavations,
will serve to guide the reconstruction of the former two-storied tower
that once dominated the southern corner of the Old Mission quadrangle.&nbsp;
The former Southwest and Northwest Convento wings of the quadrangle will
in turn be reconstructed to approximate their original appearance.&nbsp;
These will in turn serve as the new locations for the Old Mission Museum,
Gift Shop, and restroom areas that are currently housed in the remaining
convento wing building fronting the Old Plaza.&nbsp; The original convento
will in turn be returned to use as a “living history” area where period
furnishings, artifacts, and displays will serve to convey a sense of how
life was lived in the early Mission period.&nbsp; The reconstructed quadrangle
buildings will in turn serve as the locations for new interpretive exhibits,
displays, artifact and document curation and storage areas, a new gift
shop, coffee shop, and rest area.
<P><B>The Archaeology of a California Mission</B>
<P>Beginning in the Fall of 1995, the students of the Institute of Archaeology
of the California State University Monterey Bay, the Gabilan Conservation
Camp, and a host of community volunteers under my direction undertook the
beginnings of what has become a long term effort to explore, research,
and restore the archaeology and historical collections of Old Mission San
Juan Bautista.
<P>By December of 1995, excavations in the courtyard area of the Old Mission
resulted in the rediscovery of the silt stone foundations of the Southwest
and Northwest Convento wings of the Mission quadrangle and the Old Mission
Well.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, excavations were directed toward exposing
a broader cross-section of the Southwest and Northwest Convento room blocks.&nbsp;
Within the first trench were found Canton bowls, Flow Blue dinnerware,
Shell Edged plates, and Majolica ceramic shards and related Spanish, Mexican,
and European porcelains, blown-glass wine bottles of the early 19th Century,
Native American chipped stone artifacts and shell beads and ground stone
implements, and a variety of&nbsp; other items including hand-carved bone-handled
knives and forks, Spanish and Mexican era coppered-brass cannon and lead
musket balls, a variety of metal works, metate ground-stone fragments,
and early American period coins.&nbsp; By the Fall of 1996, excavations
shifted to the southern end of the existing convento wing.&nbsp; At that
location were recovered the foundations of the original Torreon or Tower
that once stood at the south corner of the mission quadrangle.&nbsp; Ongoing
excavations continue to unearth the foundations of original mission buildings
and the many artifacts that have come to inform our understanding of mission
life in early San Juan Bautista.
<P>While mission records and historical archaeology studies provide a window
on the lives of the San Juaneros of two centuries ago, it is clear that
San Juan has managed to retain much of its original charm.&nbsp; And unlike
the census of the 1870’s, which painted a dismal picture of a community
in the throes of decline – and a population of less than two hundred residents,
today San Juan Bautista boasts a population of over 1700 and counting.
<P>[Restoration Sidebar]
<BR><B>Tallow Candles and Mutsun Footprints</B>
<P>During the 1996 restoration of the Chapel of 1799, workmen reopened
a sealed archway that once connected the Chapel to the sacristy room adjacent
the Old Mission cemetery to the north.
<P>During the course of removing the adobe bricks placed in the archway
in about 1812, it was discovered that a number of the old adobes were inscribed
with artwork in the form of geometric “basketry-like” designs and both
human and animal footprints including the paw prints of a mountain lion.&nbsp;
Like the hand, foot, and paw prints and tracks of those humans and animals
found in the tiled floors of the main church, these prints make clear that
much of the adobe and tile hidden within the massive walls of the Old Mission
bear the hand and footprints of the original Mutsun Indian builders and
the many animals that once roamed freely through the Rio San Benito.
<P>The human footprints were very likely those of the Mutsun men and women
who produced the adobes that served to fill the old archway.&nbsp; At the
very top of the archway, the removal of the first few adobes revealed a
cache of some twelve to fourteen tallow candles apparently placed as an
offering so as to bless or consecrate the work in question.
<P>Once the work of restoring the chapel was completed, the Chapel of 1799,
or the Chapel of Guadalupe and that of the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament,
were blessed by the Bishop of Monterey, Sylvester Ryan, and Father Edward
Fitz-Henry, Pastor of the Mission, in a service that was accompanied by
music, song, and the reading of the scriptures.&nbsp; The dedication of
the restored chapel took place on June 24th, 1997, the official day of
the Old Mission’s bicentennial celebration.
<P><B>The Old Mission Well</B>
<P>At the center of the mission courtyard is located the Old Mission Well.&nbsp;
Though no known record provides an indication of when the well was constructed;
the presence of trash dating from the 1870’s through 1920’s suggests that
the well was used as a water source prior to the 1870’s.&nbsp; In the Fall
of 1995, the Old Mission well was exposed and excavated by the Institute
of Archaeology of the California State University Monterey Bay.&nbsp; In
an effort to restore the upper portion of the rock-lined Mission Well,
volunteers and inmates from the Gabilan Conservation Camp and the university
joined forces in an effort to excavate and rebuild the mouth of the ancient
water source.
<P>Excavations within the well produced Spanish and Mexican period canon
balls, 19th Century bottle and porcelain fragments, mission roof and floor
tiles, copper and wrought iron metal work, and a variety of shell and stone
artifacts; in addition to a host of early American period pieces including
the kaolin-clay tobacco pipes of the day.

<BR><B>Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta and the Vocabulario Mutsune</B>
<P>Fray Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, despite serious and chronic illness
that plagued him throughout his tenure at Old Mission San Juan, prepared
a number of significant historical documents and manuscripts pertaining
to the language, dialects, and culture of the Mutsune, and a number of
other early California tribal communities.&nbsp; Today, one can examine
the original hand rendered and sheep-skin bound Mutsune glossaries prepared
in Father Arroyo de la Cuesta’s own hand at the Bancroft Library, and within
the collections of Old Mission San Juan Bautista, the Santa Barbara Mission
Archive, and the Diocese of Los Angeles.&nbsp; His Vocabulario Mutsune
(1812), which is today located within the collections of the Bancroft Library,
is beautifully rendered in red and black inks on treated sheep-skin pages.&nbsp;
Whereas, Father Arroyo de la Cuesta rendered all Mutsune names in bright
red block letter ink, all Spanish translations and glossary descriptions
were rendered in a flowery Spanish colonial script.&nbsp; The following
Mutsune terms represent but a small sampling from but one of the many glossaries
and cultural histories prepared by Father Arroyo de la Cuesta.
<P>Despite his contributions, Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta’s role as an assistant
minister to Father Esteban Tapis, led Mariano Payeras, the commissary prefect
in December of 1820, to comment that: “Fray Felipe Arroyo, the other minister,
is 40 years of age, a native of Cubo in Castilla la Vieja and son of the
province of Burgos.&nbsp; In 1804 he enlisted for San Fernando and in 1807
he was sent to these missions.&nbsp; His value is from average to greater
than average, and his aptitude and disposition, though in themselves make
him fit for a great deal, promise nothing because of the already serious
chronic illnesses which for many years have put him in the position of
at least thinking about death.”
