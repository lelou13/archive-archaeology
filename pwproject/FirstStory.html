<CENTER><B>Audience Considerations</B></CENTER>

<P>In order to determine the proper scope of this learning module, several
questions must first be considered.
<UL>
<LI>
First and foremost, what group is being targeted as our primary audience?</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Will this class, or a group of grade-school aged children, be undertaking
the exercises in question?</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
How much knowledge of San Juan and archaeology will the students possess
prior to undertaking the exercises?</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
For the purposes of creating the learning module in question, we will assume
that the exercise is being completed by a group of college peers with a
very limited prior knowledge of the mission and its surroundings.</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER><B>Geography Module</B></CENTER>

<P><B>Question 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Why was the mission built at its
current location?
<B>Exercise 1:&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Students will be provided
with maps of San Juan specifically, and of California more generally.&nbsp;
Using the maps in question, the students should be able to evaluate the
mission's surroundings and determine the nature of resources and existing
cultural features that might have contributed to the original settlement
of San Juan Bautista.
<P>Initial observations should make clear that San Juan Mission was constructed
half way between the two closest missions and served as an early waystation
for travellers.&nbsp; In addition, San Juan’s location near the ocean,
and its place at the foot of the Gabilan Range and El Camino Viejo and
Real should be noted.
<P>A virtual tour (mapped images) should be undertaken via which the students
can explore the surrounding area and see the strategic advantages of the
site.&nbsp; The needs of the occupants, the identity and culture of the
occupants, defensive consideragion, natural foods, water sources, and agricultural
demands should be considered as well.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>Excavation Module</B></CENTER>

<P><B>Question 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Identify and Describe the primary
techniques and methods employed in the excavation of Old Mission San Juan
Bautista.
<B>Exercise 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Students conduct a virtual
excavation of an area in the mission and examine and interpret their findings.&nbsp;
They may use archaeology techniques drawn from the Patterson text.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Question 3:</B> How does archaeology engage the scientific method, particularly
as this relates to the analysis of the archaeological findings and historical
materials from the site of San Juan Bautista?
<B>Exercise 1:</B> From the materials recovered in the previous
exercise, students should be able to form some hypotheses as to the type
of materials the inhabitants used for everyday life.&nbsp; By reconstructing
the artifacts, a sense of the patterns and designs, painting techniques
and structure should be interpreted and described in narrative form.
<P><B>Exercise 2:</B> Younger students might reconstruct a broken dish
or plate by way of piecing together shards or ceramic fragments located
in a virtual archaeology inventory collection.&nbsp; Students will identify
like items, dates, and proceed toward a reconstruction of the artifact
so as to understand the role of their reconstruction in the interpretation
of a previously broken or incomplete "artifact."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>Cartography Module</B></CENTER>

<P><B>Question 4:</B> Why was the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista located
at its existing location?&nbsp; What factors might have gone into the decision
to locate a mission at this spot in California?
<B>Exercise 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Students will examine
existing maps of the mission and its architectural features – both existing
and archaeological.&nbsp; This would be beneficial to their appreciation
of the scope of construction activity undertaken in the past and of the
mission and its architectural "style."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Exercise 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Students will undertake
a project that requires the planning and design for a hypothetical mission
to be built in a new area so as to see what it was like to be a missionary
and mission builder.&nbsp; They should record their reasons and considerations
for the site layout and location.
<P>So as to allow students to work from an existing base of knowledge,
the location of the mission might best be located in a community or region
best known to the student or students (e.g., the student’s hometown).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Exercise 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Students will engage in
analysis of the site and its resources, both natural and cultural.&nbsp;
Students will identify all resources necessary for initiating and maintaining
the lifestyle that emerged with the Hispanicization of the Mutsune Indian
populace of the region.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Exercise 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>Students will calculate
the total volume and types of materials necessary for the construction
of the original mission quadrangle and out-buildings of the mission community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
