<p><b>Introduction</b>&nbsp;<i> (Format: double-space all text)</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this paper is to examine the behavioral
implications and cultural consequences of increased levels of street gang
activity on a Salinas Valley community.&nbsp; The community in question,
Salinas, California, is located in the agricultural epicenter of California’s
Center Coast.&nbsp; The relatively rapid urban and rural development of
Salinas in recent years, particularly for the period ranging from 1992
to 1996, has contributed to the intensification of patterns of urban sprawl
and inner-city neglect.&nbsp; This paper presents the results of an inner-city
survey of urban youth in the Las Casitas housing project.
<p><i>[Italicized section included the Who, What, Where, When, Why, and
How]</i>
<p><b>Statement of the Problem</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a careful review of the literature and a preliminary
survey of neighborhood youth in the Las Casitas housing project, it was
initially determined that the problems in question arose from the transient
nature of the population of the Las Casitas development, and the lack of
fundamental social services and civic representation in said community.&nbsp;
After a six-week period of community participation and informant interviews,
a review of preliminary findings and further examination of census track
information revealed a more fundamental pattern of concern.&nbsp; Said
pattern centers on the correspondence of single-parent households with
heightened incidents of street gang conflict and violence.&nbsp; As such,
this paper will attempt to demonstrate by way of said census and informants
interview questionnaires and their analysis, that the spectre of parental
neglect looms large and clearly plays a fundamental role while providing
a vantage point for getting at the fundamental social and economic conditions
that breed inner-city gang activity and its attendant violence (Vigil 1995:34).

statements]</i>
<p><b>Review of the Literature</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent state-sponsored studies concerned with patterns
of youth gang activity in California have been published by the California
Youth Authority (1996) and the Juvenile Justice Council of California (1994).&nbsp;
While these studies provided a point of departure for some of the initial
observations made in this paper, the work of Joan Morre (1986) has played
a more critical role in defining the gang phenomenon in question, and broader
implications borne of the role played by state institutions in serving
to promote the proliferation signs, symbols, and patterns of the larger
gang lifestyle.&nbsp; While Moore (1986) had defined the nature of the
broader California prison gang lifestyle that has come to proliferate in
California, that work conducted by this study had come to several conclusion
that depart significantly from that of Moore’s study.
<p><i>[Note reference to specific studies and final statement that illustrates
how your study will very from these earlier studies]</i>
<p><b>Methods</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interviews were conducted with thirty-five youth
gang members from the Las Casitas housing project during the summer of
1996.&nbsp; At that time, ten of the informants were documented to have
been incarcerated with the California Youth Authority within the previous
five years.&nbsp; Interviews were conducted with an eye toward discerning
the socio-economic standards within which the informants lived their daily
lives, while at the same time, obtaining data on the composition and character
of the immediate family circle of the individuals in question.

<p><b>Narrative and or Discussion</b>
<p><i>[These sections should serve to summarize and discuss the background,

<p><b>Interpretations</b>
<p><i>[Interpretations should center on those that you found to be most
relevant to your study and should in turn reflect the results of your analysis]</i>
<p><b>Summary and Conclusions</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a doubt, much work remains to be done in
the area of youth gang interventions as this pertains to the role of single-parents
households and those patterns of parental neglect that foster the proliferation
and growth f at-risk youth.&nbsp; In summary, the Las Casitas housing project
provides one point of departure for advancing preliminary conclusions on
the role of parental neglect and its role in promoting youth gang identification
and conflict.&nbsp; Among those conclusions identified here, that of….
