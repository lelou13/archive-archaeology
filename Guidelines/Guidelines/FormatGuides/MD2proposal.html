<center><b>Major Deliverable 2: Project Proposal</b></center>

<b>Objective:</b> To directly engage the planning process and
conceptualization necessary for proposing a primary or secondary research
study.&nbsp; In the case of primary research (i.e., such as the study and
reporting of materials produced in the stone tools workshop), or secondary
research (i.e., that research undertaken as the result of library, as opposed
to lab, research) the planning and conceptualization of the study and final
written report necessarily entails a pre-defined format.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b>
Because your project reports will be posted as web pages for your final
oral report, you are required to submit a second version of the project
report in "web page" format.&nbsp; Two class sessions will be devoted to
the formatting of the web page version of your final project report during
the last week of class.
<p><b>Proposal Requirements:</b> The length of the proposal should not
exceed four typewritten, double-spaced pages of text, and no more than
one page of bibliography with a minimum of five individual book or journal
article references (not to include web sites).&nbsp; The proposal should
include a cover page with the following information in the following format
order: (a) Title of Proposal, (b) Author's Name and E-mail Address, (c)
Deliverable Number and Name, (d) Class Number and Title, with Professor's
Name optional, (e) University Name, and (f) Date of Submission.

<p><b>Term Project Requirements: </b>The requirements for the Primary Research
Project differ from those of the Secondary Research Project.&nbsp; The
primary differences in this instances center on the length of the project
report submitted, and the number, type, and quality of individual references
cited in the References Cited section of your project report.
<p><b>A. Primary Research Projects:</b> Because primary research entails
the documentation of one's observations of an experiment or field experience,
and thereby requires the preparation of detailed notes on the subject of
the experiment or field experience, the page limitations for the Primary
Research Project are set at a minimum of eight typewritten, double-spaced
pages of text, and no less than five individual book or journal article
references.&nbsp; Project charts, diagrams, figures, or maps must be included
at the end of such a report.&nbsp; In addition, your lab and or field notes
should be copied and included as appendices to your report.
<b>Primary Research Format Requirements:</b> Format considerations
for a (primary research) project should include: (a) Introduction to the
Study, (b) Statement of the Problem (with thesis statement), (c) Lab and
Field Methods and Procedures, (d) Results of the Study, (e) Summary of
Interpretations, (f) Conclusions, (g) Notes, (h) Figures, Diagrams, and
or Charts, and (i) References Cited.</blockquote>
<b>B. Secondary Research Projects:</b> Because Secondary Research necessarily
entails library research, and no additional experimental or field activity,
the minimum page length, format, and the quality of reference materials
employed are critical to final evaluation of your project effort and semester
grade.&nbsp; In addition, Secondary Research Projects need to be approved
by your professor in advance of preparing the proposal, and subsequently,
in terms of completing the final project report.&nbsp; In the case of Secondary
Research Reports, minimum page lengths are set at twelve typewritten, and
no more than fifteen, double-spaced, and appropriately formatted pages
of text, and no less than ten individual book and or article references.&nbsp;
Footnotes should be included on each and every page, and in-text citation
should follow the format noted below.
<b>Secondary Research Format Requirements:</b> Format requirements
include setting the margins of your typewritten pages at no more than one
inch at top and bottom, and left and right sides of each and every page.&nbsp;
Footnotes should be integrated into each and every page, and American Anthropological
Association or Chicago Style in-text reference format should be employed
throughout (e.g., Mendoza, 1999:24).&nbsp; Each thematic section of your
report should be titled or subtitled.&nbsp; Basic titles include: (a) Introduction,
(b) Statement of the Problem (with thesis statement), (c) Review of the
Literature, (d) Comparative Discussion and or Descriptions, (e) Summary
of Findings, (f) Conclusions, (g) Notes, (h) Figures, Diagrams, and or
Charts, and (i) References Cited.</blockquote>
<b>Reference Note: </b>Though you may use Internet site references, these
are not considered primary resources for the purpose of this exercise.&nbsp;
As such, if you use Internet site references, they will need to be in addition
to the minimum of five individual book or journal article references noted
for the Primary Research Project; or, the minimum of ten individual book
or journal article references noted for the Secondary Research Project.&nbsp;
Also, separate chapters within a single book or reference are not considered
separate references for the purpose of this exercise.
<p>Gook Luck!</blockquote>
