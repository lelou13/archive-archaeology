<P><B>Description: </B>Lost Civilizations of Africa and Eurasia reviews
the rise and fall of ancient states and civilizations in Africa, Asia and
Europe. With an emphasis on the civilizations of Africa and Asia, and to
a lesser extent Europe, this learning experience will review the comparative
development and contributions of those ancient cultures and civilizations
identified with regions as diverse as Mesopotamia and Indochina, and as
complex as ancient Egypt, Sub-Saharan Africa, India and Iraq. Because this
learning experience is comparative in scope, such ancient cultures, kingdoms
and states as those of dynastic Egypt, Meroe, Sumer, Harappa, Xianyang,
Zimbabwe, Uruk, Angkor, Knossos, Pagan, and Masada serve as the primary
case studies for this exploration into the archaeology of complex societies.
The comparative approach of this learning experience will rely on materials
ranging from internet sites and CD-rom resources through readings, videos,
lectures and problem-oriented discussions and overviews that serve to frame
the rise of civilization in Africa and Eurasia.</P>
