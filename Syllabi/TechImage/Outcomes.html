<B>Learning Outcomes:</B> You should note that each of the following SBSC
Major Learning Outcomes and CSUMB University Learning Requirements are addressed
in part by specific deliverables and lab and field assignments that are
required of participants in this Virtual Learning Lab in Technical Imaging.
Please consider these learning outcomes and requirements as you plan your
projects and work toward the completion of your respective contributions
to this learning experience. Further information on each and every one of
these outcomes is available in published form in the 1996/1997 CSUMB Catalog.
<H3><CENTER>SBSC Major Learning Outcomes </CENTER>
</H3>
The following Major Learning Requirements or MLO's are specific to the learning
outcomes required of all Social and Behavioral Sciences majors at the California
State University Monterey Bay. These Major Learning Outcomes include:<B><BR>
<BR>
SBSC Area 1</B> (Theory; e.g. Demonstrated ability to understand, recognize,
and apply social science concepts and approaches in the examination and
study of cultural and societal developments in all times and places)<BR>
<BR>
<B>SBSC Area 2</B> (Information Management, Data Retrieval, and Analysis;
e.g. demonstated skills in managing and qualitatively interpreting that
information specific to photographic and cultural materials that serve to
document case studies borne of specific community studies)<BR>
<BR>
<B>SBSC Area 3</B> (Specialized Competencies in the Social Sciences; e.g.
demonstrated development of skills in the use of principles and methods
drawn from visual anthropology and archaeological photography for the purposes
of producing photographic documentation specific to ethnographic and archaeological
studies of the Salinas Valley of central California) 
<H3><CENTER>CSUMB University Learning Requirements</CENTER>

The following CSUMB University Learning Requirements are more fully addressed
in the CSUMB 1996/1997 Catalog. It should be noted that each of these outcomes
is addressed in part by the various deliverables and in the form of the
final term project that you will submit for final assessment within this
Virtual Learning Lab.<B><BR>
<BR>
ARTSCOM </B>(The ability to demonstrate an understanding of how the arts
affect cultural preservation or change while at the same time producing
a work of art that communicates to a diverse audience; e.g. production of

appropriately and respectfully; (c) comprehend community-identified assets
and needs from community-defined perspectives; and finally, (d) analyze
these assets and needs in their broader institutional and social context;
e.g. production of a photographic essay and field journal based on a study
of the oldest families residing within the community of San Juan Bautista)<B><BR>

with that of another culture, particularly as this pertains to those relationships

if the group studied is different and distinct from your own)<BR>
<BR>
<B>ENGCOM</B> (Ability to demonstrate empathic and critical listening skills,
production of a written text, and oral communication of a complex idea to

and social science field methods that employ photography as a research tool)<BR>
<BR>
<B>EQUITY</B> (Production of an informed interpretation of the tensions,
possibilities, and ethical concerns inherent in building equity and in using
historical, contemporary, and future cultural resources in the context of

<B>TECH</B> (Demonstrated comfort with technology, and the ability to use
technological tools effectively, politically, creatively, and ethically
