<H3><CENTER>Primary Learning Requirements</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Students will be introduced to both fundamental and advanced techniques
in the photographic and technical processes underlying the use of technical
imaging in the social sciences. Exercises will stress a variety of fundamental
skills aimed at the development of a <A HREF="Portfolios.html">photographic
portfolio</A> that bridges the art and science of photographic methods as
applied in social science contexts.<BR>
Each student will be required to obtain and learn the fundamental skills
underlying the use of the 35mm camera. A photographic portfolio will be
the primary requirement of this learning experience, whereas, a photographic
<A HREF="../lab%20and%20field%20journal">lab and field journal</A> will
be the second major requirement. Because assigned readings will serve as
the basis for your introduction and advancement in technical imaging skills
development, you are expected to provide documentation that you have in
fact completed all <A HREF="../assigned%20readings">assigned readings</A>.
This may be done by way of your photographic journal. Because this is a
lab and field-based learning experience, your <A HREF="../attendance%20and%20participation">virtual
and actual participation</A> will serve as the third primary measure of
assessment. Primary assessment of your learning experience will be by way
of <A HREF="../scheduled%20interviews">scheduled interviews</A> with your
professor at midterm and end-term. Individual photographic assignments will
be submitted and evaluated on a weekly, or as needed, basis for evidence
of your attainment of basic technical proficiencies and the appropriateness
and quality of specific images intended for inclusion in the <A HREF="Portfolios.html">final
photographic portfolio</A>. Please note that all final portfolios for this
learning lab should follow the appropriate format for that specified for
the photographic portfolio, and should not include extraneous materials
that have not been specifically requested.

<H3><CENTER>Precautions for Lab and Field Exercises</CENTER>
</H3>
Due to the nature of the lab and field projects that will be undertaken
in this learning experience, it may be necessary from time to time to wear
protection (i.e. rubber, cotton, or leather gloves, helmets, lab coats,
protective goggles, respirators, etc.) and use tongs or other appropriate
tools for the handling of materials. In<B> </B>no instance<B> </B>should
you<B> </B>risk endangering<B> </B>yourself or<B> </B>other members<B> </B>of
the<B> </B>team by<B> </B>engaging in<B> </B>actions that<B> </B>create
unnecessary<B> </B>risk in<B> </B>the lab<B> </B>or field<B> </B>-- such<B>
</B>as those<B> </B>risks resulting<B> </B>from the<B> </B>careless handling<B>
</B>of chemicals,<B> </B>equipment, and<B> </B>artifacts. Where lab<B> </B>and
field<B> </B>exercises are<B> </B>concerned, you should be<B> </B>prepared
to wear protective<B> </B>eye gear,<B> </B>rubber or<B> </B>cloth gloves,<B>
</B>and respirators<B> </B>where necessary<B> </B>and or<B> </B>appropriate.
For those that have difficulty with heat, cold or humidity, you should take
the necessary precautions to avoid heat exhaustion, dehydration, or other
stressors when engaged in field exercises.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><B><A HREF="Liability%20Release%20and%20Waiver%20%28Hold%20Harmless%29">Liability
Release and Waiver (Hold Harmless):</A> </B>A Liability Release and Waiver
or Hold Harmless form is required of all students participating in this
particular lab and field experience. While this is a formality, it does
provide us with documentation that you have been informed of the risks of
participating in the lab and field exercises of this lab and field-based
learning experience.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><B><A HREF="Multimedia%20Release%20and%20Waiver%20Form">Multimedia Release
and Waiver Form:</A> </B>Because photographs, video, and other forms of
multimedia recording may be used to document lab and field exercises, you
are required to sign a Multimedia Release and Waiver Form so that said materials
may be used by the instructor, staff, and students of this institution in
project-based learning experiences and projects that entail multimedia development
and production. See the form for further details regarding options to the
rule.<BR>
