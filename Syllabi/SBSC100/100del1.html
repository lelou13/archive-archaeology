Produce a written description of an article from an approved social
science journal (specifically any of the areas of anthropology,
archaeology, social history, or cultural geography). Your description
will consist of no more than a 500 to 750 word essay. The essay
will identify and position the author within the social sciences,
and serve to assess how that position influenced what he or she
wrote, and will describe what the article was about while at the
same time providing an overview of the major points presented.
In preparing your essay, you should provide examples of the kinds
of evidence the author used and indicate what types of primary
and secondary sources he or she consulted. Finally, you will be
required to explain how the author of your respective social science
essay applied one of the theories discussed in class, and you
will in turn assess the validity of the author's respective conclusions.
