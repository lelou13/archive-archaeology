<P><B>Features 5 and 6: A Preliminary Statement</B>

<P>During the course of the late Fall of 1996 and the first two months
of 1997, project efforts were redirected to salvage efforts at Feature
5 (located at the southern end of the existing Southeast Convento Wing
fronting the mission), and the beginnings of Trench 2, Feature 6 (Units
0n42, 2n42w, 4n42w, and Units 10n42w, 12n42w, and 10n41w). Whereas the
excavation of Feature 5 arose as the result of the removal of an old slab
of concrete lying at the south end of the sidewalk-covered arcade fronting
2nd Street, the excavations at Trench 2, Feature 6, have been undertaken
so as to determine the location and extent of the Northwest Convento Wing.

<P>Preliminary findings from Feature 5 provide indications that (a) the
area in question has remained largely undisturbed since about the late
1860's, and (b) that the adobe wall that fronts the existing Southeast
Convento Wing room block once extended well into the present-day road bed
of 2nd Street. According to personal communications with Leo Barker, the
moderator of this session, archival materials from the Santa Barbara Presidio
indicate that the mission and adjacent barracks buildings (i.e. the Plaza
Hotel and Castro-Breen Adobe) were once surrounded by a large perimeter
wall. This may serve to explain the presence of massive (130cm wide) sandstone
foundation footings extending along the course of the front of the mission
and directly into the road bed that constitutes 2nd Street. This same circumstance
obtains for a massive wall footing that extends southwesterward into 2nd
Street along the course of the central load-bearing wall foundation of
the Southeast Convento Wing at Feature 4. In this latter instance, the
wall segment in question would appear to have been associated with the
Old Torreon or tower that once stood at the southern end of the southeast
or existing convento wing (see Egenhoff 1952:87, Figures 83, 84, 98, 142,
164, and 186).
