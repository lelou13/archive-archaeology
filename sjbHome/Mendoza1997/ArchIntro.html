<P><B>Archaeology at Mission San Juan Bautista</B>

<P>The current programme of archaeological investigations being undertaken
at the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista were initiated under my direction
in October of 1995 and first reported at the annual meetings of the Mission
Studies Association in April of 1996. Father Edward Fitz-Henry, the current
Parish priest and administrator of Mission San Juan Bautista, first sought
this collaboration in an effort to find assistance in the development of
an historic preservation plan for the Old Mission. Since that time, several
project initiatives have been undertaken so as to accomodate the ongoing
effort to prepare for the planned bicentennial celebrations of the Old
Mission that will commence on June 21 and 22nd of 1997. In addition to
the archaeological investigations documented here, the Alta California
Mission Research Project of the California State University Monterey Bay
has also undertaken other related efforts that include: (a) the EDM-based
electronic survey and mapping of the Old Mission and adjacent adobe structures,
(b) the creation of a CD-ROM based interactive instructional program (see
Mendoza &amp; Halla 1997 Society for California Archaeology conference
paper for an overview of the program in question), (c) an ongoing program
of consultation and intervention centered on the renovation and restoration
of existing mission era facilities including the original Indian Chapel
of 1799, (d) the development of a Museum Education Project specifically
devoted to the renovation, restoration, and redevelopment of the exhibits
and displays of the Old Mission Museum, and (e) the coordination of professional
and volunteer efforts to restore the mission grounds and gardens, including
the restoration and reconsolidation of the Old Mission water well and related
historic features.
