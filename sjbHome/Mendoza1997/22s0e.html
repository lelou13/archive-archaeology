<P>Unit 22s0e eventually produced a section of the interior sandstone wall
foundation of the southwest convento wing as well a section of the sole
surviving redwood arcade post from the interior of the quadrangle. Other
materials from this and other units include ceramics (terracotta, stoneware
and porcelains of Spanish, Mexican, English, French, Chinese, Japanese,
and Phillippine origin), metalwork including hand-carved and incised bone-handled
knives and forks, substantial quantities of roof and floor tile, adobe
block and melt, stucco, glass bottle fragments (many bearing an opalized
sheen), animal bone (including deer, pig, cattle, horse, oxen, bear, bull,
rodent, poultry, rabbit and the like), and finally, other more unique items
among which were included Native American and Spanish era trade beads,
and the recovery of a one-karat gemstone of the aquamarine variety.
