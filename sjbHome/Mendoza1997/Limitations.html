<P>As for those limitations bearing on the findings reviewed herein, it
should be noted that like much of that archaeology bearing on recent research
in Hispanic colonial California and elsewhere, several conditions and circumstances
bear on that research completed to date. The first of these circumstances
concerns the fact that the mission and community of San Juan Bautista was
preparing for its bicentennial celebrations which are centered on the June
24th, 1797 founding of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista. While the
preparations for said celebration made possible the research undertaking
in question, the bicentennial celebration also created significant limitations
and preconditions that have had a direct bearing on project objectives
and the rate of progress maintained thus far. The second factor of direct
concern to this research effort is that pertaining to the project-based
instructional nature of the field and lab efforts completed to date. As
with any field school, lab and field training is a necessary and significant
precondition for successful project outcomes (Dallas 1989; Hastings, et
al, 1977; Simpson-Smith and Edwards 1996). In this specific instance, the
project was initiated under the tandem constraints of the impending bicentennial
celebration and the limitations and constraints posed by the administrative
responsiblities and duties of the founding faculty status of the project
director, Dr. Ruben Mendoza, of the new California State University at
Monterey Bay (cf. Mendoza 1996). Despite those challenges and limitations
encountered during the first year of this project effort, the investigations
documented herein have proceeded without significant interruption since
the Fall of 1995.
