<P><B>Summary of Preliminary Findings</B>

<P>Recent investigations into the architectural history and archaeology
of the Old Mission quadrangle and courtyard of San Juan Bautista have resulted
in the formulation of several preliminary conclusions regarding the development
and decline of this early California mission community. Among those findings
deemed suitable for presentation at this time and within this venue, the
following preliminary conclusions are hereby advanced:

<P>(a) Dietary evidence indicates that a broad range of animals and agricultural
products were processed within the Old Mission Courtyard and consumed in
or about the mission compound at San Juan Bautista,

<P>(b) Foreign imports from Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, China, Japan,
the Philippines, and other areas of the Americas, were utilized in the
mission community of San Juan Bautista, and this despite apparent colonial
era restrictions against such trade,

<P>(c) Locally produced and imported late colonial majolica wares were
used at San Juan Bautista and have been recovered from archaeological deposits
in the Southwest Convento Wing as well as from other sectors of the mission
quadrangle of San Juan Bautista,

<P>(d) A single clustering of French porcelains, metal artifacts (including
a French bale-seal), in association with an early house floor feature,
appears to indicate a discrete ethnically-identifiable complex on the site,

<P>(e) The purported mission quadrangle so often ascribed to the architectural
format of San Juan Bautista has been confirmed via the recovery of an intact
southwestern and northwestern series of room blocks defined by way of archaeological
trenching,

<P>(f) Existing evidence indicates that the southwest and northwest room
blocks of the Old Mission quadrangle were consumed by a fire of as yet
unknown origin (contrary to Farris 1991, this fire does not appear to have
been for the purposes of dismantling the buildings for salvage purposes),

<P>(g) Preliminary interpretations indicate that the Torreon or guard tower
at the southern corner of the mission quadrangle was part of a three, and
possibly four, towered mission quadrangle complex (much like that ascribed
to the "fortaleza" style of Texas mission architecture),

<P>(h) The Torreon or guard tower at the south corner of the mission complex
was constructed as a primary feature of the initial quadrangle construction
episode of 1799-1806 (Jackson and Castillo 1995:162, A3.20), and was later
accomodated into the expansion of the Southeast Convento Wing, and finally,

<P>(I) The Old Mission Well has been located at the center of the mission
quadrangle and appears to have gone dry in the 1860's or 1870's, at which
time the well was recycled for use as a trash receptacle for materials
deposited therein between 1870 and 1925.

<P>As noted, this investigation represents the collaborative efforts of
the Institute of Archaeology of the Calfornia State University at Monterey
Bay, the parish community of Old Mission San Juan Bautista, the Diocese
of Monterey, and the Gabilan Conservation Camp at Soledad, California.
Without these participants in the process, the valuable work of this project
would not be possible.
