<P><B>Project Participants</B>

<P>At this point it should be noted that whereas the students of the Calfornia
State University Monterey Bay are the principal student project participants
in the archaeological field program at San Juan Bautista, other dedicated
volunteers and project assistants have been forthcoming from several local
community colleges, including Hartnell in Salinas, Cabrillo in Aptos, and
Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, California. Where project excavations,
and the renovation and restoration of historic features and museum displays
is concerned, this effort has been borne by the students of CSUMB under
the direction of Dr. Ruben Mendoza, and the volunteers of the Gabilan Conservation
Camp at Soledad, California, under the direction of Lt. Flavio Silva and
staff. Furthermore, it should be noted that a number of project volunteers
and donors have been forthcoming from San Juan Bautista and vicinity. Donations
by Granite Construction Company of Seaside, Hayward Lumber, Tynan Lumber,
and the San Juan Bakery are especially appreciated. Finally, it should
be noted that all project mapping and EDM survey efforts have been conducted
and coordinated by Mr. Joe James of Bakersfield, California, and Dr. Ruben
Mendoza of the CSUMB Institute of Archaeology; whereas GIS database development
has been the work of Mr. Justin Evans of Santa Cruz, California; and project
CD-ROM and multimedia development has been undertaken by Mr. Ken Halla
of San Juan Bautista, California.
