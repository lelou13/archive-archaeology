<P>Initial project excavations began in the mission courtyard at Units
18s8e, 22s0e, and 12n2w. Unit 18s8e was set at a location where surface
indications provided indications of burnt stucco projecting above the existing
surface of the courtyard floor. Because a visiting local archaeologist
had indicated at that time that he believed that the material in question
was modern, it was decided that project excavations would begin at that
particular area of the site. As a result of excavations on the site noted,
it was in fact determined that over eight thin layers of stucco capped
an earthen floor replete with posthole cavity and associated materials
which have been dated by association with a French bale-seal and related
transfer-ware porcelains dating to the period prior to 1810. The bale-seal,
or royal French property tag, consisted of a small (approximately 1.75
centimeter diameter) thin copper disk bent in half and either perforated
by a nail for attachment to a trunk, or by way of a hole created for suspension
on an aboriginal type necklace of those types known from the Louisiana
Purchase territories of North America. The interior of the bale-seal contains
the inscription of the name "Louis XVII" or "Louis XVIII," and bears the
image of a human face in profile. It would appear that the French emperer
in question remained in power for little more than a year prior to the
intervention of Napolean Bonaparte in 1803.
