<P><B>Feature 4: El Torreon</B>

<P>Due to the fact that those materials recovered from Feature 4 are currently
undergoing analysis, and the complexity of the architectural materials
recovered therein presently preclude the possibility of advancing a coherent
interpretation, I will refrain from advancing any preliminary interpretations
of Feature 4. Suffice it to say that while we have good cause to believe
that we have exposed the original foundation footings of the Old Torreon
or guard tower at the southern corner of the Old Mission quadrangle, we
have also recovered sandstone footings pertaining to architectural additions
constructed in circa 1810. The recovery of Native American beads, firepits
or hearths, and pre-1830's porcelain plates and two 1860's American silver
coins provides a range of dates pertaining to the occupation of this sector
of the Old Mission compound.
