<br>The illustrations on this page provide but one more example of the
types of multimedia imagery currently being created by the students of
the Institute of Archaeology.&nbsp; By way of this web site, and related
multimedia byproducts such as CD-Rom publishing, the byproducts of the
Alta California Mission Research Project at San Juan Bautista will eventually
provide students and teachers with a virtual history tour and educational
resource for the teaching of California archaeology, art, and history.&nbsp;
Revisit this site soon so that you too can track our progress in documenting
the archaeology, art, history, and culture of the early California community
of San Juan Bautista.
<p>The Storyboard Graphics illustrated on this page provide (a) an introductory
image from a Macromedia Director video introduction (Storyboard Graphic
1), (b) a still image from a virtual walkthrough portion of the CD-ROM
(Storyboard Graphic 2), and (c) one example of a virtual text with clickable
page content, and audio and visual components. The task bar at the bottom
of the screen was an early version of the navigational format prepared
in an early student multimedia project undertaken at San Juan Bautista.
<p>The images on this page were created from photographs by Institute of
Archaeology student Ken Halla in 1998.&nbsp; For Further Information on
this or related Institute Projects, contact Ruben Mendoza at <a href="mailto:ruben_mendoza@monterey.edu">ruben_mendoza@monterey.edu</a>.
