<b>Two men were walking home after a Halloween party and decided to take a shortcut through the cemetery just for laughs. Right in the middle of the cemetery they were startled by a tap-tap-tapping noise coming from the misty shadows. 

Trembling with fear, they found an old man with a hammer and chisel, chipping away at one of the headstones. 

"Holy cow, Mister," one of them said after catching his breath, "You scared us half to death -- we thought you were a ghost! What are you doing working here so late at night?" 

"Those fools!" the old man grumbled. "They misspelled my name!" </b><br>

<b>The Director of the CSU Monterey Bay Institute for Archaeology has just completed 
a Ground Penetrating Radar probe of two early California Mission sites. Both San 
Carlos Borromeo del Rio Carmelo and San Juan Bautista were probed during the week 
of June 30th, 2003 by Professor Mendoza and Matthew Turner of GeoModel, Inc., 
a GPR company based in Leesburg, Virginia. ASTV project assistant Rob Lecel, and 
project volunteer Harvey Sandoval, both contributed immensely to those efforts 
necessary for preparing the areas for the GPR survey in question. Our prime objectives 
included the search for the original Mission era wine cellars of both Carmel and 
San Juan Bautista; as well as the remains of the Lost Convento complex at San 
Juan Bautista. Watch this site for future postings of the results of the survey 
as they become available.</b><br>

<hr>Ruben, We are looking forward to the Grand Opening of the Luck Museum
for the San Juan Bautista Historical Society on June 3 at noon at the VFW
with chicken BBQ. Hope to see you and the students there; the general public
is invited as well. Arch Hayes will speak on the Larios family influence
on San Juan. We plan a ribbon cutting and photo session about 3 at the
Museum at 3rd and Monterey. Ted was here last week, and we planned what
houses in town to document more closely for his Capstone project which
will eventually end up here on the Web Site. Keep up the great work. Reservations:
(831) 623-4542 [Our new phone/fax line will be in next week at (831) 623-2001.]

<hr>Dear Dr. Mendoza, We had to do our mission in something other than
legos. My teacher didn't want the legos. I don't know why. That's okay
though. We decided to build the mission with styrofom. It looks good.It
took us 7 hours. My favorit part was putting in the cemetary and the jail.We
took the inside of some cardboard and painted it red for the roof. Mom
wanted to by a kit but Iwouldn't let her! I hope you like the pictures.Thanks
for all of the help. Hope the digging is going well. Your friend, Steven
Lenoir</font></b>
