<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The correct format for the entry of catalog
numbers is as follows:&nbsp; "<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>00000.00</font></font>".&nbsp;
In other words, the required format consists of five digits to the left
of the decimal point, and two digits to the right.&nbsp; For example, the
catalog number "<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>00345.00</font></font>"
would be the equivalent of catalog number "<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>345</font></font>".
<p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that you have entered a catalog
number that produces an error message, or you find a duplication of the
catalog number in the database, simply use the two digits to the right
of the decimal point to assign a new "temporary" number.&nbsp; For example,
if catalog number 00345.00 has already been used in the database, but the
catalog card itself bears the same number, simply renumber the catalog
number "<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>00345.01</font></font>" or
"<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>00345.02</font></font>"...taking care
to use the two digits to the right of the decimal point as your new temporary
catalog number.
<p><b>3.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct format for all date entries is as
follows: June 19, 1999 would be entered as "<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>6-19-99</font></font>"
and June 19, 2001 would be entered as "<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>6-19-01</font></font>".<b></b>
<p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>If you enter a record and select "New Record"
and a pop-up window indicates a "New Record Error." You may have problems
with any of the following:
<b>a. </b>Catalog number has already been taken by another
record. In that event, use the last two digits (after the decimal point)
to change the number by one numeral (e.g. from 00989.00 to 00989.01). If
this doesn't work, and you receive another "New Record Error," then you
can change the last two digits one or two other times until the record
enters (e.g. 00989.02 or 00989.03). If you change the catalog number in
the database record, you must also change the new catalog number on the
artifact bag tag as well.
<p><b>b.</b> Date field is either incomplete (e.g. 6-98) or incorrect (e.g.
6-00-98). Use correct format (e.g. "<font size=+1><font color="#3366FF">6-15-98</font><font color="#000000">"</font></font>)
or leave field blank.
<p><b>c.</b> Catalog number is entered incorrectly or in the wrong format.
You should have five number spaces to the left of the decimal point, and
only two number spaces to the right of the decimal point.
<p><b>d.</b> Before changing the number due to an error, please be sure
that all fields or entry areas are entered completely and in correct format
(e.g. 6-15-98 for dates; 00983.00 for catalog numbers).</blockquote>
<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Anytime that you change the catalog number
in the artifact database, you must also change the number on the artifact
bag tags.
<p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>If you encounter a "Artifact Type" or "Material
Type" that is not already included in the pop-up list in the database,
please make a note of that fact and Dr. Mendoza will add the artifact or
material type to the database for use in future record entries.
<p><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>If you have a suggestion, or have noticed
some error, or limitation, with the database, please e-mail Dr. Mendoza
by clicking on the "ASTV E-mail" button on the top-right portion of the
Institute of Archaeology Web Site at http://archaeology.monterey.edu
<p><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>When adding catalog numbers to a catalog
card, please use either one of the numerical stamps provided by Professor
Mendoza. Please change the number stamp by one digit each time that you
assign a number to a bag tag or catalog card. Do not exceed the 99 number
in any series of 100. In other words, if the number stamp that you are
using is set at 658 at the time you begin using it, do not use a number
higher than 699. In addition, when you are finished using the stamp for
the day, please note on a card kept with the stamp the last number that
you entered that day (please include both last number, date, and time of
last use).
<p><b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>When providing catalog numbers, or preparing
descriptions for the database, please be prepared to remove the artifact(s)
from the artifact bag so that you can more closely examine the artifact
on each side for the purposes of providing a more complete description.
Always return the artifact to the artifact bag in the same location that
you found it. The proper placement of the artifact should be to the back
or behind the written portions of the catalog card. The decorative or more
distinctive side of the artifact should placed so as to face outward to
the back of the artifact bag. Ultimately, all catalog information should
be visible on one side of the bag, and on the other side of the bag, the
more distinctive features of the artifact contained therein should be visible
to the viewer without the need to remove the artifact from the artifact
bag.
<p><b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>At the end of your database session, please
shut down Netscape or other Internet browser so that the password protected
portions of the site will not be tampered with by the next user.
