<P><B>The Archaeological Recovery of the Mission Quadrangle</B>

<P>Prior to initiating the archaeological investigation of Mission San
Juan Bautista, an EDM-based electronic mapping survey was of the mission
courtyard and buildings was initiated by Mr. Joe James and myself in an
effort to set the primary north-south datum line for the project area.
A tentative site datum was set at the south corner of a large concrete
pavement at the approximate center of the mission courtyard. The northernmost
datum point on this line was in turn set at twelve meters true north and
zero meters true west of the preliminary datum point noted.
