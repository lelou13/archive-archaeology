<P>As the result of indications that the project team had stumbled upon
an exposed wall or foundation feature potentially related to the Old Mission
water well that was rumored to have been located at the heart of the mission
complex, excavations were initiated at site Unit 12n2w, Feature 1. The
recovery of an old hand-forged copper handle of that type used to tether
ropes over loads on 19th century wagons led to a focus on the excavation
of the old well constituted by site Units 12n2w and 12n0w (thereafter designated
Feature 1). Early project efforts were directed to the exploration of the
Feature 1 rock-lined water well from the Fall of 1995 through to the Spring
of 1996. Much of the material recovered from Unit 12n2w consisted of materials
ranging from mid-19th century British porcelain transfer-wares through
to broken bottle glass dated to 1925. Primary exceptions to the more common
body of roof and floor tile, glass and porcelain, included the recovery
of a Native American abalone shell cross, lead works and scrap materials,
fragments of oxidized and melted metals and coal and coke fragments (of
that type used in the forging of metals), and much architectural debris
and kitchen midden. Recently, the volunteers of the Gabilan Conservation
Camp facilitated both the reconstruction of the sandstone well feature,
and the construction of a tile and timber roof so as to permit the well
to remain open for public viewing during the Old Mission's bicentennial
celebration. Currently excavated to a depth of some 1.75 meters, or nearly
five feet, the well contains midden deposits spanning the period from the
1860's through 1925 (the date contained on a beverage bottle from that
portion of the top of the well left undisturbed). Preliminary indications
suggest that this well went dry in the late 1860's or 1870's, at which
time the empty well became a trash midden and was used as such for a period
of well over fifty years. Other indications confirm that in the early 1960's,
two workmen at the mission excavated to a depth of approximately two feet
and promptly reburied materials recovered at that time. Along with those
items that were reinterred in the well cavity, the workmen deposited an
early 1960's Hamms aluminum beer can which was recovered intact within
the first twenty centimeters of backfill at the top of the well.
