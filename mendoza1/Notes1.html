<P>1. Neuerberg (1989a:npn).

<P>2. This assumption is based on the balance of architectural features
present in other areas of the Old Mission quadrangle. The Old Mission Model
created by the inmates of the Atascadero State Mental Hospital similarly
infers the existence of said gateways.

<P>3. Kenneth Halla, personal communication based on interview with local
contractor, March 24, 1997.

<P>4. See Clemmer (1961) and Farris (1991:11) for discussion on the use
of the Neophyte Family Housing Area or Taix Lot Site for the housing of
unmarried Indian men and women. It may well prove to be the case that the
notion that the main quadrangle at San Juan Buatista mission was used for
the housing of unmarried Indian women is in fact in error as per the housing
of said women at the Neophyte Family Housing Area which lies some 500 feet
due southeast of the Old Mission quadrangle.

<P>5. According to Farris (1991:5) "San Juan Bautista eventually had one
of the largest mission Indian populations known for California. It reached
its peak in 1823 with 1248 Indians in residence."

<P>6. It is more likely that the weekly slaughter documented for the Old
Mission of San Juan Bautista included some 50 cattle at any one time. According
to Fray Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta's report of 1815, "The mission enacts
a slaughter every week" (cf. Farris 1991:6). In addition, any other cattle
butchered during the course of any given week were likely butchered for
the trade in meat, tallow, and skins.

<P>7. By 1834, the year after the secularization of the Old Mission of
San Juan Bautista, the mission Indian population of Ohlone-Mutsun people
had fallen to approximately 850 individuals (Farris 1991:9).

<P>8. Charles W. Clough (1996:24).

<P>9. According to Jackson and Castillo (1995:99, Table 7), the mission
estate of San Juan Bautista was worth some $138,973.00 pesos at the time
of secularization. This made the estate of San Juan Bautista the most valuable
of any of the Alta California mission holdings as of 1833.

<P>10. Long-term field project volunteers from Hartnell Community College
currently include Vicki Sordia, Cara Davis, Maria Larios, and Sue Keller
(Spring 1996 to present). Long-term CSUMB student participants and project
volunteers include Ken Halla, Keith Iida, Joyce Salcedo, Brenda Pobre,
and George Borg (Fall 1995 to Spring 1997). The efforts of the Gabilan
Conservation Camp have been faciliated through the sponsorship of camp
commander Lieutenant Flavio J. Silva and the heartfelt dedication and volunteer
participation of Ms. Brenda Pobre, Museum Education Program coordinator
(November 1996 to present).

<P>11. Due to concerns regarding potential future damage to existing archaeological
features, Father Edward Fitz-Henry first directed me to identify and map
the original convento courtyard area.

<P>12. Personal communications recorded in Fall of 1995.

<P>13. It should be noted that a map of the mission grounds rendered in
the 1860's, and obtained by Mr. Ken Halla, projected the existence of an
enclosure for the Old Mission compound, however, the map in question stopped
short of indicating the presence of actual wall footings for the mission
quadrangle.

<P>14. As of December 1997, the discovery of a porcelain clay pipe cut
into the sidewalls of the old well suggests that the well was an active
feature used at that time for drainage. The recovery of a dated 1925 bottle
fragment fruther suggests that the pipe and the bottle glass are contemporary.

<P>15. The recovery of several items of French origin resulted in naming
Feature 2 "the French Quarter."

<P>16. Many of the more diagnostic artifacts recovered prior to May of
1996 have been placed on temporary display in the Old Mission Museum of
San Juan Bautista.
