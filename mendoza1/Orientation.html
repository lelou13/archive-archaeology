<P><B>Project Orientation and Rationale</B>

<P>Whereas the existence of the two storied tower (or torreon) that once
stood at the southern end of the southeast convento wing fronting the plaza
has been documented from various sources, and recovered archaeologically
as a result of this project effort, little to no documentary evidence is
said to support the existence of the purported quadrangular enclosure so
often assumed to have served as a central feature of the early mission
community of San Juan Bautista (see Baer 1958; Egenhoff 1952; Ehrenberg
1849; Engelhardt 1931; Johnson and Krell 1979; Miller 1856, cf. Miller
1985, 1993; Schuetz-Miller 1994). In addition, it should be noted that
early in this investigation several historians visited the project area
and in fact questioned the existence of the very mission quadrangle that
loomed large in our project directives. As two of these investigators noted,
little to no documentary evidence exists that actually points to the former
layout of the quadrangular enclosure so often assumed to have served as
a central feature of the early mission community. In addition, one of these
same historians has questioned whether or not the southwest and northwest
convento wings would have been spared the many years of road expansion
and disturbance associated with the road bed of modern-day 2nd Street that
fronts the mission on the southwest side. As a result of these basic and
apparently unresolved issues into the architectural history of Mission
San Juan Bautista, project objectives were first oriented to the salvage
and recovery of any information deemed critical to the remapping of the
original mission quadrangle; particularly in light of whether or not said
quadrangle could actually be located and recovered.
