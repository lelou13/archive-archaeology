<P><B>Introduction</B>

<P>This paper presents an overview of recent archaeological findings and
historically-informed interpretations at Site SBN-1H, Old Mission San Juan
Bautista, California. The project investigations documented here center
on those efforts specific to archaeological explorations conducted by the
Alta California Mission Research Project of the Institute of Archaeology,
California State University Monterey Bay. Most of that work conducted to
date has focused on the archaeological evaluation of the architectural
history of the original mission quadrangle at San Juan Bautista (Mendoza
1996a and 1996b). The following overview melds a preliminary overview of
the mission's history with a reappraisal of said history in light of the
archaeological findings reported herein.
