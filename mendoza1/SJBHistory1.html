<P><B>The Old Mission's History</B>

<P>The Old Mission of San Juan Bautista was founded on June 24, 1797 by
Fray Fermin Lasuen of the Franciscan order regionally based at Mission
San Carlos Boromeo del Rio Carmelo (Carmel). Established as the 15th of
the twenty-one missions and five assistencias of the Alta California mission
chain, Old Mission San Juan Bautista was named for the patron saint of
that day upon which the mission was founded; that being the saint's day
of Saint John the Baptist, and hence the name of the mission and community
of San Juan Bautista. The mission church of San Juan Bautista is unique
in so far as its overall size and its status as the only three-aisled mission
in the Alta California mission chain. The overall layout of the mission
complex is that of a gated quadrangular enclosure; access to the center
of which was made via two primary gateways extending through the Southeast
convento wing, and by extension, the northwest convento wing of the quadrangle.
Water was secured from a rock-lined artesian well or wells located at the
center of the quadrangle enclosure (one of which is currently undergoing
archaeological investigation under the auspices of the Alta California
Mission Research Project) and another which has been claimed for the cemetary
side of the Old Mission Church.

<P>Built on a ridge created by the uplift of the San Andreas Fault, the
Old Mission stands immediately above and slightly to the west of the San
Andreas on that half of the geological formation identified with the Pacific
Plate, whereas the Old Mission orchard immediately to the east lies on
that half identified with the American Plate. Each of these geological
formations grade against one another thereby creating the faulting and
earthquake activity for which San Juan Bautista and much of north-central
California is known.

<P>Mission life at San Juan Bautista, particularly during the early years
prior to the secularization of the California missions, was centered on
the consolidation of access to natural resources and on the religious conversion
of Native Americans to Christian doctrine and to their cultural conversion
and political incorporation into the Spanish empire and its frontier cultural
traditions and political economy (Bannon 1964; Jackson and Castillo 1995;
Kennedy 1993; Kessell 1979; Mendoza and Halla 1997). While Christian teachings
and doctrines framed the course of daily life and the larger goals of the
missionaries, the isolated conditions of the frontier required that each
mission, and San Juan Bautista was no exception, determine and define itself
in terms of self-sufficiency and contributions to the growth of towns and
the broader settlement of frontier regions and establishment of colonial
institutions (Clough 1996; Engelhardt 1931; Farris 1991). The early Padres,
or mission priests, were largely renaissance types who often plied their
skills in administering Christian doctrine along with such other skills
a ranching and stock raising, agriculture and irrigation works, architecture
and construction, wood and metal craftsmanship, accounting and management,
fundraising, facilities maintenance, and of course, the planning and coordination
of the community's respective social agenda (Jackson and Castillo 1995;
Mendoza and Halla 1997; Weber 1978).

<P>Where those activities centered on the mission buildings themselves
is concerned, the southeast convento wing served as the primary living
quarters of the mission Padres, and included dormitories, kitchens, and
reading rooms; whereas the southwest and northwest convento wings are thought
to have served as housing for unmarried Native American female converts,
and for the storage of provisions and supplies. At the center of the existing
southeast convento wing still stands the Old Mission kitchen area where
meals were prepared on a daily basis for a mission Indian population that
eventually rose to a height of 1248 native inhabitants by 1823. According
to an old museum caption in the Old Mission kitchen, as many as 50 cattle
per day were slaughtered and prepared for meals during the height of the
missions population growth. Shortly after 1809, the mission Indian population
fell dramatically and by the 1820's, the mission population had fallen
to below 1,000 persons. Though questions remain as to why this particular
population decline occured when it did, prevailing views presuppose that
disease and attrition were the primary factors underlying this decline
of the Mutsun Indian population of mission San Juan Bautista. By the advent
of the 1830's, the effects of the new and independent government of Mexico
City were already being felt as far afield as missions San Juan Bautista
and Solano in northern Alta California. At San Juan, the Mexican congressional
decree of March 20, 1829, that ordered the expulsion of all Spaniards from
Alta California, only served to heighten tensions within the mission system
and further served to disrupt Hispanic colonial life in the farflung province
of Alta California. On August 17, 1833, Mexican law ordered the secularization
of the mission system and the partitioning of all mission lands and holdings.
This decree ultimately led to the collapse of the mission system in Alta
California. The failure of the secularization order to complete with the
redistribution and parcelling of mission lands to the Indian inhabitants
of Alta California fueled the decline of the mission communities and the
dismantling and confiscation of mission holdings, including existing buildings,
farm lands, art works, and furnishings. Farris (1991:26), in recounting
the problematic character of findings related to the roof tile fall within
rooms from the Neophyte Family Housing Area (Taix Site) of San Juan Bautista,
has documented "ample evidence of a careful stripping of the old buildings
to obtain the complete tiles for probable re-use in other structures...in
the post-secularization period."

<P>Recent archaeological excavations of the Old Mission quadrangle of San
Juan Bautista, by the Institute of Archaeology of the California State
University Monterey Bay, has resulted in several preliminary findings of
interest and or concern to archaeologists and historians concerned with
Spanish or Hispanic colonial archaeology in Calfornia. These findings are
briefly summarized in the following project narrative.
