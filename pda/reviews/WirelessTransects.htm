      <h2 align="center">Wireless Transect Survey Methods</h2>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

      <br>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> &nbsp;The prime objective of this field exercise is to conduct an archaeological transect survey using wireless Pocket PC technology and a Wireless Journal or Field Book as the basis for your record keeping. &nbsp;Because this approach is absolutely unique and unprecedented in the field of archaeology, you will become pioneers in the field of Wireless Archaeology for a day. &nbsp;Please note that although archaeological surveys that employ transect-based - or line of sight - pedestrian surveys of culturally sensitive or archaeologically significant areas is not unique, the use of wireless computers, and Pocket PC's in specific, is in fact new and innovative. &nbsp;In order to proceed with the wireless transect survey, we will reassemble on the campus quad in order to proceed.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Instructions</strong>: The transect survey in this instance will seek to identify any and all cultural remains, including artifacts, rubbish, and related indicators of human behavior, as represented on the campus quad or mall. &nbsp;Although much of what we will see consists of landscaped lawn areas, your task is to assemble into groups of five in the area immediately in front of Building 18. &nbsp;Your first task will be to create a starting line - composed of five individuals equidistantly spaced at 10-foot intervals one from the other -- perpendicular to the Building 18 complex. &nbsp;Having established the starting point for the transect survey, you are then to proceed as follows:
      </p>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Each team or group of five will select a Group name and will provide said name to the instructor and or to the coordinator of the wireless devices. &nbsp;This Group Name will be used as a form of identification when posting Wireless Journal or Field Note entries.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;The first team will be provided both a compass and a single wireless Pocket PC. &nbsp;One member of the group will be assigned the compass, and another will be assigned the Pocket PC. &nbsp;The Pocket PC will be pre-configured to the wireless settings necessary for the campus wireless network (see "PDA Interface" and drop down listing for the "User's Guide at <a href="http://wireless_archaeology.csumb.edu">http://wireless_archaeology.csumb.edu</a>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>3.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;The first group in the lineup will first use a measuring tape to position each group member at 10-foot intervals. &nbsp;Once positioned, the first team will place survey flags at the starting point. &nbsp;Additional flags will be placed at the other end of the mall once the initial starting positions have been determined. &nbsp;The compass and or the flags at the other end of the mall should provide the basis for maintaining your positions along the linear transects.
      </p>
      <p><strong>4.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;For the initial team using the compass to orient itself, you will first obtain a compass bearing from your professor at the outset of the transect survey. &nbsp;The team member who wields the compass will stand at the midpoint of the initial team of five and will seek to assure that all team members follow the line-of-sight transect, and remain equidistantly spaced, and focused on the compass bearing throughout the exercise.
      </p>
      <p><strong>5.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Your professor will signal that point in which you are to begin the transect survey and you will proceed to walk along the flag or compass-oriented line of sight from one end of the campus quad to the other. &nbsp;At regular intervals of 50 paces - the actual distance of which will be determined by the gait or stride of the group leader positioned at the center of the row -- you are to take note of any and all material culture or trash, and artifacts, found within that location. &nbsp;You are to record your observations at regular intervals of 50 paces using the "Wireless Journal" or "Field Notes" section of the Wireless Technologies website found at <a href="http://wireless_archaeology.csumb.edu">http://wireless_archaeology.csumb.edu</a>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>6.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have completed the transect by reaching the survey flags located at about 325 paces from the starting point, you will make your last entry to the Wireless Journal using the wireless network and the Pocket PC. &nbsp;At that point, you are to return the Pocket PC and compass, to your professor or the project technician.
      </p>
      <p><strong>7.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon completing the transect survey, you are to await the completion of each group's survey, and during your wait you are welcome to monitor how other groups proceed with their approach to the field exercise.
      </p>
      <p><strong>8.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;After all groups have completed the transect survey, you are to return to the classroom with your professor and will proceed to open the Discussion Forums located at <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/phpbb2">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/phpbb2</a> and should post your comments under the General Discussion link to an entry posted by your professor and titled "SBSC 224s/324s Wireless Transect Survey." &nbsp;Upon entering, you should click on the "Post Reply" button and proceed to include the names of all group members who assisted in the survey for your group.
      </p>
      <p><strong>9.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;As a group, you are to post your observations and interpretations of any and all findings as recorded in the field, and are to use those Wireless Journal entries produced during the transect survey itself to post comments in the Discussion Forums. &nbsp;Please consider the following questions in preparing your observations in the Discussion Forum:
      </p>
      <p>a. What types of trash or material culture, artifacts, or aspects of the landscape predominated at each of the intervals located at 50 paces?
      </p>
      <p>b. What does the trash or material culture at each of those locations surveyed have to say about the sorts of behavior that you believe is most predominant at each of the respective intervals studied?
      </p>
      <p>c. Take note of the types of buildings and their functions when making your cultural assessments: What does the trash say about the sorts of activities most associated with said buildings and their functions?
      </p>
      <p>d. Taken as a whole, what sort of cultural assessment would you make about the most prominent sorts of behaviors that typify the use of the campus quad area?
      </p>
      <p>e. If looked at through the eyes of an archaeologist from an alien civilization, what do you think the trash and material culture in question would say about the humans who currently inhabit this campus?
      </p>
      <p>f. Please assess your experience with the use of wireless technologies in archaeological transect surveys. &nbsp;Was your experience worthwhile and did the technology perform in a way that you believe was effective, ineffective, exciting, impractical, problematic, or useful?
      </p>
      <p>g. Finally, what do you believe transect sampling has to offer the study of past cultures and alien civilizations?
