      <h2 align="center">EXCAVATION PROCEDURES</h2>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Data Control</h3>

      <p>The first law of archaeological excavation is Data Control and we will be strongly enforcing it at CA-MNT-18. This involves the labeling of all archaeological materials form the moment they are removed from the unit. &nbsp;This is absolutely necessary in any site if the site data is going to be reconstructed after the excavation has destroyed the context. The only way archaeologists can make scientific statements about change over time is if the materials excavated are clearly identified as to their placement of origin in the ground. &nbsp;There is no uniform/standardized implementation of data control throughout the region. &nbsp;The Principal Archaeological Investigator in the project design usually determines the procedures for data control and interpretation.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Field Notes</h3>

      <p>Note taking is probably the most important activity in an archaeological excavation. &nbsp;It is in fact an art that requires practice and a good deal of concentration, however, the rewards are worthwhile. &nbsp;The field notes will be used in the processing, analysis stages, and in the preparation of the final report. &nbsp;Keep in mind that archaeological excavation is a destructive process!! &nbsp;The statigraphy can never be restored to its original state. &nbsp;The recording that you do on a daily basis will be the only first-hand record of the site components.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>General Categories of Field Methods</h3>

      <p>When the area of excavation has been chosen, the next step is to choose the appropriate excavating method. &nbsp;The decision depends on the type of site and the goals of the excavation. &nbsp;We will be doing an <b>Arbitrary Level Excavation</b> at CA-MNT-18. &nbsp;This means we will be digging by levels (10 centimeter increments) using one corner as the datum level point.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Unit Layout – Define and String a unit</h3>

      <p>The unit layout uses the geometrical model for the measurement of a right triangle. &nbsp;Measuring 3 x 4 x 5 triangles most easily accomplish this task. &nbsp;Done properly the procedure will assure 90 degrees in all 4 corners. &nbsp;The equipment needs will include: 1) sledge, 2) nails, 3) 3 tape measures, and 4) a line level.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Define the unit:</h3>

      <p>1. Using 3 tapes measure out a triangle of 3:4:5 proportions using the corner of 3/4 as the northwest grid corner of the unit. &nbsp;Put a nail at that corner (X).</p>

      <p>2. Next, measure out 1 meter to the east along the 3 lines and place a nail (the northwest grid corner) and 1 meter to the south along the 4 lines and again, place a nail (southwest grid corner).</p>

      <p>3. Reverse the tapes moving the corner of 3/4 as the northeast grid corner of the unit.</p>

      <p>4. Place a nail at 1 meter to the south along the 4 lines. &nbsp;This should give you a 1-meter square unit. &nbsp;Check the diagonal measurement, it should be the square root of 2 meters = 1.412 meters.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Equipment</h3>

      <p>The majority of the excavation equipment will be stored in the lab area of the Carmel Mission. &nbsp;It is important that all of the equipment be well organized and easy to find. &nbsp;Students will be expected to return all equipment to the "proper” place at the end of the day.</p>

      <p>The number and variety of implements used in archaeological excavations are many. &nbsp;Each site is unique and varies in environmental and cultural components. &nbsp;These often require specialized tool kits. &nbsp;There are some basics that you will need to begin with when excavating a unit.</p>

      <p>Trowel</p>

      <p>Pocket measuring tape with metric and inch measurements</p>

      <p>Line level</p>

      <p>Gloves, protection for your hands and soil will dry them</p>

      <p>Writing materials</p>

      <p>Permanent felt black tipped pen</p>

      <p>Dust pan</p>

      <p>Buckets</p>

      <p>Hand pick</p>

      <p>Shovel</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Beginning the unit</h3>

      <p>The actual digging process requires careful observation and patience. &nbsp;After the unit has been defined with nails and  string, the first step is examination of the surface.</p>

      <p>The unit will be dug with all or a combination of the following tools depending on consistency of the soil: <b>shovel, trowel, pick, and whisk broom and dental pick</b>. &nbsp;Your task is to use the grossest tool possible while maintaining complete control. &nbsp;Control means vertical sidewalls and careful removal of only one level at a time. &nbsp;You will remove all of the level and put it into labeled buckets. &nbsp;The label will contain the unit number, level number and objective. &nbsp;While excavating carefully watch for any change in soil color, moisture, texture and type. &nbsp;Report your findings to Dr. Mendoza or the crew chief.</p>

      <p>Excavate the unit in an orderly fashion beginning with the tool layout. &nbsp;All un-necessary tools are staged away from the edge of the unit. &nbsp;Excavation tools being used are neatly lying within easy reach of the excavator(s). &nbsp;When not in use the line level string is curled over the datum nail (assuring it won’t get tripped over). &nbsp;Choose one corner of the unit to begin (roughly a ¼ of the unit). &nbsp;Staying just inside the two guidelines begin digging in one corner with a trowel, whiskbroom, and dustpan. &nbsp;“<i>In-situ</i>” or in place exposure is a primary goal for excavators. &nbsp;Generally, if you encounter fist size or large rocks, bones, change in soil, etc. back away, move around it leveling the section as best as possible leaving a couple of centimeters sidewall clean for later. &nbsp;Move to the next section and repeat the same process. &nbsp;Once one half the unit is excavated, trim the completely exposed sidewall so that it is vertical with the string line.&nbsp;
         This requires getting out of the unit and looking down at the string and unit, then scraping the wall from the top. &nbsp;Complete the process in the remaining section including all three sidewall trimming.&nbsp;If there was an item/s encountered and avoided in the level now is the time to explore it. &nbsp;Carefully remove the soil above and around the item/s. &nbsp;Don’t remove the soil below the item/s. &nbsp;This will act as a pedestal to support the items within the level. This will allow the level to be totally recorded and the decision to be made to either remove it or work the next level around it. &nbsp;If noticeable soil changes appear within your excavation unit please check with Dr. Mendoza or the crew leader for further consultation on procedure.</p>

      <p>Crewmembers of each unit will take turn excavating and screening, making sure you have experience at all tasks. &nbsp;As you dig each unit, dirt will accumulate. &nbsp;Keep loose soil from obscuring your view of the unit floor. &nbsp;This is accomplished by sweeping the soil with a whiskbroom and dustpan. &nbsp;The soil is then placed into a labeled bucket and is ready to be dry screened through the 1/8” and ¼” screen.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Dry Screening</h3>

      <p>Most archaeologists use a screen box of about 2’x3’ with extending handles. &nbsp;The screen box pivots on one vertical leg. &nbsp;The screener vigorously shakes thescreen back and forth until all the loose soil has gone through the mesh. &nbsp;Quickly sort through what remains in the screen. &nbsp;Throw away current vegetation and rootlets. &nbsp;Keep all materials either identifiable or unknown. &nbsp;These will be washed, sorted, weighed and recorded in the lab.</p>

      <p>Excavated dirt is poured in the waist-high shaker screen while it is laying flat on the ground (unless someone volunteers to pour for you). &nbsp;Don’t fill the screen too full. &nbsp;Pour the majority toward the handle end of the screen. &nbsp;To lift: after the handle is lifted slightly place one foot behind one led of the screen then pull back toward you. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Once all materials are collected, the screener will walk the materials over to the lab area and make sure they are adequately checked in before he or she leaves.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Safety</h3>

      <p>There are a few basic rules to observe on archaeological sites:</p>

      <p>Turn the hoe or shovel’s point-side down at all times when not in use.</p>

      <p>Keep tools and other materials out of the traffic patterns.</p>

      <p>Look behind you before swinging a pick or shovel.</p>

      <p>Watch out for other people’s hands when working in the tight corners of the unit.</p>

      <p>Be as neat as possible with your belongings; don’t disperse them over the work area.</p>

      <p>Dangling jewelry can tangle with equipment. &nbsp;Do not wear such jewelry while in the excavation units or screening areas.</p>

      <p>We are a team with a common goal, please be as courteous as possible.</p>

      <p>Always lift from the knees, and not the back. &nbsp;We will be lifting heavy materials, so please be careful and save your back.</p>
