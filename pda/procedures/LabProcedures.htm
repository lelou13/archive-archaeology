      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Data Control</h3>

      <p>Data control is imperative to all activities of the field laboratory. &nbsp;The first data control task is to assign each bucket of dirt recovered from the unit you are working on a <b>Unit Number, Level Number and Objective.</b> &nbsp;Do this by tying the plastic flagging to the handle of the bucket and writing on the flagging with a black permanent pen.</p>

      <p>All recovered material from the dry screen should be placed on a clearly labeled plastic tray or in a clearly labeled plastic lab. &nbsp;The information that should be included on either the tray or the bag is as follows:<b> Site designation (CA-MNT-18), Unit Number, Level Number, Objective, Excavators and Screener’s initials and date</b>.  It is the responsibility of the screener to see that the recovered materials are transported to the field lab in a timely manner. &nbsp;</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Cleaning of Recovered Materials</h3>

      <p>The first step in processing the materials in the field is to wash them in preparation for analysis. &nbsp;First, you should prepare a tray with a layer of paper towels to absorb the water from the washed materials. &nbsp;This tray should be clearly labeled with the <b>Unit Number, Level Number, Objective, Excavator and Screener’s initials and the Date. &nbsp;</b>Washing will be preformed in either a bucket or an available sink. &nbsp;A toothbrush can be used to gently remove dirt from the surface of the objects. &nbsp;BE CAREFUL! Do no brush materials too roughly! &nbsp;After washing materials lay them out on the tray to dry. &nbsp;You may begin to sort into materials types if identifiable at this time. &nbsp;Allow time for the materials to dry.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Field Processing</h3>

      <p>Once the materials are dry, Sorting and Cataloguing of materials can take place.</p>

      <p>1. Use your hands, a small paintbrush, or tweezers to sort the materials into categories. &nbsp;Some of the categories are as follows: <b>shell, lithic debitage, glass, metal, ceramic, rock-FCR, roof tiles, foundation material, wood, bone, charcoal, etc… </b>You may want to use sorting cups to keep the items separate.</p>

      <p>2. For Quality Assurance, Have someone other than yourself check your sort/identification.</p>

      <p>3. &nbsp;Now you are ready to fill-out informational cards, count, weigh and bag the materials by type. &nbsp;Each type of material will receive its own bag and informational card. &nbsp;Each bag will receive its own individualized Catalog and Field Specimen Number. &nbsp;Please consult the lab director for the Field Specimen Number. &nbsp;<b>Make sure that the site designation (CA-MNT-18), Unit Number, Level, Objective, Material Type, Weight, Count, Date Recovered, Excavator(s) and Screener(s), and Recorder(s) are all listed on the informational card.</b> &nbsp;This card is placed in the plastic bag with the sorted material.</p>

      <p>4. After filling out the information card and sorting the materials from a specific unit and level, the information must also be recorded in the catalog. &nbsp;This catalog will be retained by either Dr. Mendoza or Michelle St. Clair at the end of the day and will be available from them at the beginning of the day. &nbsp;It is imperative that all completed bags and information cards be recorded in the catalog! &nbsp;Do not forget! &nbsp;The information recorded in the catalog is as follows: <b>Unit Number, Level Number, Objective, Material Type and Weight.</b></p>
