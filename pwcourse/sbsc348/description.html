<P>Description: An exploration of the spectacular archaeological, epigraphic,
and historical discoveries that have revolutionized emerging perspectives
on the culture and civilization of the ancient Maya of southern Mexico and
Central America. Classic Maya civilization, which has traditionally been
dated to between A.D. 250 and 900, has been found to have evolved far earlier,
and persisted far longer than once thought. Epigraphic or Mayan glyphic
studies and research currently underway in the Maya heartland clearly attest
to the antiquity and richness of a culture and civilization that evolved
and endured in the Mesoamerican tropics for nearly three thousand years.
Course content will draw upon an ever expanding world of &quot;virtual&quot;
software-based glyphic translation and astronomical and calendrical correlation
programs created for the purpose of probing directly into the rich literary,
artistic, and historical traditions of recently recovered ancient Maya texts
and monuments. This learning experience will examine the social, cultural,
economic, political, and religious underpinnings of the Maya dynastic tradition
in comparative and cross-cultural terms and from the perspective of landmark
archaeological projects and glyphic interpretations, and their respective
significance in deciphering the larger Maya lifeway.</P>
