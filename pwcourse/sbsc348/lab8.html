<B>Description:</B> Anthropologists and other social scientists are often
faced with the daunting task of interpreting a cultural scene, setting,
or event. The purpose of tonight's exercise is to have you interpret one
person's construction of a cultural reality. Given that your professor currently
has an exhibit on the subject of the Maya in Building 49, we will be heading
to building 49 (World Languages and Cultures on &quot;A&quot; Street and
Sixth Avenue) between 5:45 and 6:00 p.m. this evening. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. Break into your pre-assigned group or team.
If you do not have a team designation, or are included within a group too
small to collaborate, please join the members of the next smallest team.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. Having come together, each team member should
be assigned a key role in interpreting one specific image from the collection
or exhibit in question. Because this should be a collaborative assignment,
each team member should have an assigned task (e.g. interpretation, notetaking,
translation, etc.). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. Whereas your individual interpretations should
hinge on the analysis of a specific image and its content, your group interpretation
should combine each individual appraisal into one larger interpretation
of the theme, its content, and cultural message. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Prior to reconvening for the purposes of discussing
the individual images in a group context, each team member should prepare
a one paragraph description of what they believe the specific photographic
image or artifact has to say about the Maya in general, and this exhibit
in particular. You should be prepared to submit this proposed individual
interpretation at the end of today's class. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. In addition to preparing the individual interpretation
and description of your chosen image, your group should in addition prepare
one thematic statement centered on the overall content of the larger collection
of images and or artifacts. This statement should center on an overall impression
of the Maya based on the content and subjectmatter of the representations
in question. Bear in mind that this is but one view of the Maya based on
one photographer's vision of a people...both past and present. </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT><HR ALIGN=LEFT>
