<B>Description:</B> Your final Lab Deliverable for this course will require
a brief -- five minute -- oral presentation and project overview of that
study undertaken by you for the purposes of your final term project. So
that we can best coordinate the presentations within the parameters of that
time available to us (Tuesday, May 19th, from 5:00 pm to 7:50 pm), you will
conduct your presentation from within the context of your normally assigned
group. </FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
  1. For the purposes of coordinating your topics into broader &quot;themes,&quot;
  please break into your pre-assigned group or team. If you do not have a
  team designation, or you are in a group too small to collaborate effectively,
  please join the members of the next smallest team. If the other members
  of your assigned team have chosen topics widely different than your own,
  you may wish to join another team. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. Having formed your team, each member of each
  team should identify their respective oral presentation topic or group
  theme, and each group should then decide on the order of the presentations
  to be delivered by each team member during next week's final class session.
  </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. The first or last presenter of each group will
  serve as the monitor or moderator of each presentation. The moderator is
  to monitor the amount of time used by each presenter, and is to signal
  to the presenter when they have only one minute remaining for their respective
  time limit. Because we may run short on time for presentations if time
  limits are not strictly enforced, the moderator's role is critical. <I>Each
  moderator will coordinate the creation of a list of topics and presenters
  and submit said list by the end of today's session.</I> </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. The moderator chosen for your respective group
  should collect all group names and topics in that order in which said topics
  will be presented. Your speaker's list should include the following: (a)
  moderator's name, (b) group theme, (c) presenter's name by numbered order
  of presentation, (d) presenter's topic, and (e) audiovisual needs. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Please be prepared to start your group's presentations
  at the outset of the time allotted (i.e., no later than 5:10 pm). Out of
  respect for your peers, it is advised that each team's members remain for
  the duration of the class presentations. The ordering of the groups themselves
  will be determined by lots (i.e., &quot;a flip of the coin&quot; or &quot;straws&quot;).
