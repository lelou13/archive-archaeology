<P>You may e-mail your questions and requests for advising via the student
e-mail accounts available to you. The &quot;SBSC Classes&quot; (SBSC 248/348)
folder serves as a forum for depositing on-line assignments, and the SBSC
Peer Counselors are available at Building 17 for your assistance.</P>

<P><B>Important Notice:</B> When submitting deliverables and other assignments
via the internet, please provide a clear and complete identification label
for your submissions. For example: Joan Doe, who is registered in the lower
division portion of the Spring 1998 Maya class, and who is submitting Major
Deliverable 2, would title her e-mail submission and attachment as follows:
<B>sbsc248.doe.F98.md2</B> (upper or lower case letters are acceptable).
<I>Any </I>assignment <I>that </I>does <I>not </I>contain <I>the </I>title
<I>format </I>in <I>question </I>will <I>not </I>be <I>accepted </I>for
<I>evaluation</I>.</P>

<P>All electronic submissions should be dropped into the &quot;Class Folder&quot;
specific to the section within which you are enrolled: i.e., SBSC 248 submissions
should be dropped in the SBSC 248 Classes Folder, whereas SBSC 348 students
will submit their assignments in the SBSC 348 Classes Folder.</P>
