As an initial foray into the world of Maya glyph interpretation and translation,
we will begin with a basic assignment that makes use of a flashcard set
in order to conduct an interpretation of a specific Maya monument from the
site of Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico. The following instructions will serve
to guide you through the process of interpreting the Maya monument in question.

  1. Break into your pre-assigned group or team. If you do not have a team
  designation, or are in a group too small to perform, please join the members
  of the next smallest team. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. Having come together, each team member should
  be assigned a key role in interpreting the monument in question. Because
  we will be working in three languages (mainly, Maya, Spanish, English),
  and the interpretation itself is part of a group effort, each team member
  should have an assigned task (e.g. interpretation, notetaking, translation,
  etc.). </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. Using the glyph handouts distributed last week,
  including the handout of the monument itself, first interpret, and thereby,
  predict, the direction and format of the translation that you will undertake.
  </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Prior to translating the monument, each team
  member should provide a one paragraph description of what they believe
  the monument has to say about the site of Palenque, Chiapas. You should
  be prepared to submit this proposed interpretation at the end of class
  today. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Having completed your paragraph-length description
  of your thoughts on the monument, each group will be provided with a portion
  of a larger set of flash cards with Maya glyphs. Using the flash cards,
  match, identify, and transcribe that portion of text on the monument panel
  that you have been assigned. Please bear in mind that the cards are translated
  from Maya to English. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6. Prepare your portion of the transcription,
  and for those terms that may or may not translate directly, please use
  the Maya-Spanish dictionary with translations provided under your instructors
  guidance. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">7. Please bear in mind that there is no right
  or wrong answer in this Lab Deliverable, and all sections transcribed will
  be written out on paper and one person from your group should forward (by
  e-mail) the Maya-English transcription, along with Group or Team Color
  or Name, and the names of all participants involved in today's exercise.</FONT>
