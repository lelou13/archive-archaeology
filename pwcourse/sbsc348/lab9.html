The interpretation of Maya glyphs is directly dependent on the ability of
the interpreter to match the existing Maya syllabary and its vowel and consonant
sounds with contact period and contemporary Maya language dictionaries.
Today's exercise will require that you (a) translate a series of Maya glyphs
into their phonetic (or vowel and consonant) formations using the Maya syllabary,
and (b) construct a Maya syllabary-based phonetic reconstruction of your
name or some related name of interest to you. The following instructions
will serve to guide you through the process of interpreting the Maya monument
in question. </FONT></P>

  1. Break into your pre-assigned group or team. If you do not have a team
  designation, or you are in a group too small to collaborate effectively,
  please join the members of the next smallest team. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. Having come together, each team member should
  be assigned a key role in interpreting the monument in question. Because
  we will be working in three languages (mainly, Maya, Spanish, English),
  and the interpretation itself is part of a group effort, each team member
  should have an assigned task (e.g. interpretation, notetaking, translation,
  etc.). </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. Using the glyph handouts distributed this day
  (syllabic, calendrical, numerical, logographic, etc.), including the handout
  of the Panel of the 96 Glyphs, identify the specific phonetic elements
  contained within that set of individual glyphs with which you are working.
  Be prepared to identify and differentiate logographic, calendrical, and
  syllabic (phonetic) elements within your glyph set. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Having identified the format and formula for
  constructing the phonetic composition of a glyph set, each group will select
  a specific date (e.g. birth date or graduation date) and you will then
  call on your professor to provide a computer generated Maya date. You will
  record the date provided, then begin to construct the Maya glyph panel
  for that date in the form of a hand-rendered drawing of the glyph panel
  that would be appropriate to the date in question. </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Each team will draw one set of the glyph date
  in question, and will then move to create a team or individual name rendered
  in Maya phonetic elements and or logographic form. You will submit your
  Maya glyph panel, date, and Team name or logo at the end of the session.
  Each member of the team must sign or add their name to the final creation
  in order to receive individual credit for Lab Deliverable 9. </FONT>
