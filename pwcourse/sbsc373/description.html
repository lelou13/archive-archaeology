<B>Description:&nbsp; </B>Virtual Archaeology is that area
of archaeology that integrates multimedia and information systems in an
effort to deploy electronic and computer-assisted technologies in the 3-D
visualization, reconstruction, and modelling, and identification of archaeological
sites and materials. Because electronic technologies have as of late revolutionized
the communication and modelling of scientific information, this course
will survey the world of virtual archaeology and visualization, and GIS
applications in both prehistoric and historic archaeology. Course applications
will center on three primary approaches to the visualization and modelling
of archaeological sites and materials, including:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
(a) the use of multimedia applications for the reconstruction of sites
and artifacts,</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
(b) the exploration and potential of recent applications in 3-D visualization
for archaeological site interpretation,</LI>
</UL>

<UL>and,
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
(c) the use and or potential uses of GPS (Global Positioning System) and
GIS (Geographic Information System) applications and technologies in archaeology.</LI>
