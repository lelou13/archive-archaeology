<CENTER><B>Lab Deliverable 2: Stone Tool Analysis</B></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Introduction:</B> The production of stone tools is an activity
that first appeared at the dawn of human culture.&nbsp; Because of the
virtually indestructable nature of the materials used -- mainly flint,
chert, and obsidian -- the residues of human stone tool production and
use can be preserved for literally millions of years.&nbsp; As such, we
have stone tools and related evidence from ancient East Africa of the first
human or hominid tool makers of some 2.5 million years ago.<BR>

<P><B>Directions:</B> This Lab Deliverable will entail two meetings during
which time you will be (a) introduced to the means by which stone tools
were crafted by ancient societies (Session 1: via video and a hands-on
demonstration by your instructor), and (b) via a hands-on stone tool experiment,
artifact mapping, and collection and quantification.&nbsp; Because we will
require a space adequate to the task of producing and documenting stone
tool production, Session 2 will take place in the Archaeology Lab in Building
110 (behind Module 86C, see Map).<BR>

<P><B>Session 1: Introducing Stone Tools:</B>
<P><B>1.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefully review the "Flintknapping" video
by Dr. Bruce Bradley and the "Ancient Cultures and Modern Chemistry" (ChemLab)
video (or the Fall 1997 SBSC 224sl/324sl flintknapping demonstration video).&nbsp;
Be prepared to take detailed notes (for submission with your final portfolio)
of the demonstration and the methods described.&nbsp; Your description
should be detailed enough to allow another person to use your notes to
learn about stone tool production methods.<BR>

<P><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; After the video review and discussion, your
professor will provide examples and a hands-on demonstration of the types
of materials and tools used in the production of stone tools.&nbsp; You
should prepare notes based on your observations and your professor's demonstrations
of the tools and techniques noted.&nbsp; You should prepare responses to
the following questions based on based on both the video and the demonstration:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>(a)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly identify and
define the following flintknapping methods: (1) hard-hammer percussion,
(b) soft-hammer percussion, and (c) pressure flaking.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>(b)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be prepared to discuss
why each of the aforementioned methods were used.&nbsp; In other words,
when and why would an ancient stone tool producer use "hard-hammer percussion
" versus "soft-hammer percussion" versus "pressure flaking"?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>(c)&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; How do archaeologists
go about distinguishing tool types one from the other?&nbsp; How do archaeologists
go about identifying the function of stone tools from archaeological sites?
<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; How does "experimental
archaeology" figure into the study of stone tools?&nbsp; What value and
insights are offered by experimental archaeology in so far as the interpretation
and study of stone tools is concerned?<BR>

<P><B>Session 2: Creating and Interpreting Stone Tools:</B>
<P><B>1.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; For next week, please read and prepare notes
based on Chapters 2 and 11 in the Whittaker book "Flintknapping."&nbsp;
While Chapter 2 will provide a basic introduction to the methods of stone
tool production, Chapter 11 provides an overview of how archaeologists
go about studying stone tools.&nbsp; These notes will be required in your
final portfolio.
<P><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet at the usual class location, and be
prepared to go to the Archaeology Lab in Building 110 about one half hour
after the beginning of class.&nbsp; Upon arrival at the usual class location,
we will discuss the readings and take a roll call of all students present
for the trip to the Archaeology Lab.&nbsp; After the discussion, we will
proceed to the Archaeology Lab.
<P><B>3.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you will be handling sharp stone
tools materials, you will be required to use gloves and goggles during
the lab exercise.&nbsp; In addition, you should come prepared with long
pants so as to protect your knees from sharp obsidian glass fragments.
<P><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the lab exercise, you will first
observe your professor's demonstration and take notes of any and all methods
used in the demonstration.&nbsp; You will be given an opportunity to experiment
with some of the stone tool material if you choose to do so.
<P><B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the demonstration, you will
be required to count, collect, and weigh the stone tool materials deposited
in each 20 cm x 20 cm square indicated on the gridded tarp used for the
demonstration.&nbsp; As groups, you will submit your counts, weights, and
notes on the demonstration via E-mail to: astv@archaeology.ml.org
