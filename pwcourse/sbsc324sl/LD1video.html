</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Directions:</B>&nbsp; You will review the video "Myths and
Moundbuilders" (Odyssey, 1988) and will produce notes relevant to three
primary issues discussed in the video.&nbsp; You should be prepared to
include your video notes in your final portfolio, and your responses to
the following three questions should be E-mailed to Professor Mendoza at
astv@monterey.ml.org (click below or enter address via Firstclass Intranet)
by the next class period.
<P><B>Questions:</B>&nbsp; Please provide your response to the following
three questions.&nbsp; Your response should reflect your understanding
of the three issues based on class discussion and video-related notes produced
during the viewing.
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify the primary "myths" of archaeology and
the moundbuilders as noted in the video commentary.&nbsp; Having first
identified the principal myths noted, please discuss what you feel serves
to explain the origins of the myths in question?
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What value would you ascribe to the "mound reconstruction"
experiment undertaken by the archaeologists portrayed in the video?&nbsp;
Why was the experiment important, and what did the experiment seek to demonstrate?
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflect on the value and approach represented by
the so-called "salvage archaeology" approach portrayed in the video.&nbsp;
Please bear in mind that several of the archaeology projects depicted in
the video were undertaken so as to "salvage" the remains of sites under
threat of destruction by development or public works projects.&nbsp; Based
on what you observed, and indicated in your notes, what is "salvage archaeology"
and how is it beneficial (and or destructive) to the interpretation of
the prehistory of North America?
