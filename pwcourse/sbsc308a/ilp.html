<BR>
The Petition to Major includes the development of an Individual
Learning Plan (ILP). This plan defines students' learning outcomes and
explains how these learning outcomes will be achieved; either by pathways
(i.e., course works), field experiences, service learning, or prior experiences
in the workplace or in life. In particular, it describes what the student
has done and will do in order to become competent in the three Major Learning
Outcomes required for the SBS degree. Each ILP contains both required and
optional learning experiences.
<P>The ILP features learning pathways and learning experiences that help
students assess, with guidance from faculty and staff, their own progress
toward graduation and toward meeting their professional and career goals.
This Individual Learning Plan is essentially a contract for graduation
once approved. Lower level students at CSUMB are introduced to the idea
of outcome based learning through the SBSC introductory experiences; they
may begin their ILP in these courses (SBSC 100A and 100B). For upper- level
students (junior and senior transfer students), the ILP is authored during
their first semester SBSC 308 Professional Assessment Lab.
<P>A final Assessment Portfolio is submitted shortly before graduation.
This portfolio is assessed to evaluate the achievement of the SBS learning
outcomes. Such a portfolio may also provide support for the achievement
of CSUMB University Learning Requirements. The portfolio may take the form
of hard copy and multimedia or electronic (HTML or CD-ROM) documents that
will become the student's permanent record of achievement within the Social
and Behavioral Sciences Center at CSUMB.
<P>This assessment process is directed by the assessment professional.
The students may request the assistance of other CSUMB faculty members
in a review of the ILP. This assessment will include a review of any traditional
(alphanumeric) grades assigned to their courses, as well as a review of
their performances as articulated in the ILPs. It will be at this time
that the assessment professional may schedule consultations with other
faculty and the student to assess progress toward achieving the competencies.
The results of this review will become part of each student's senior graduation
portfolio and may be included in an updated ILP.
