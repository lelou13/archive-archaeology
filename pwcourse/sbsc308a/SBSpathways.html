<B>Note:</B> The following information provides general guidelines
for interpreting the basic "Learning Plan" or "Pathway" required of all
students in the SBSC.&nbsp; Please bear in mind that your particular circumstances
and prior learning or assessments may allow you to forego some of the following
requirements.&nbsp; If you have questions or concerns about what it is
that you need to take in the way of coursework, always be prepared to ask
your major advisor(s) about that learning pathway that will best suit your
