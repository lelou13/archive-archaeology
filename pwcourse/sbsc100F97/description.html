<P><B><I>ProSeminar 100 </I></B>provides the foundations needed for academic
life at CSUMB and for life-long learning. It is a pathway to meeting the
developmental standards required by the CSU System and CSUMB in reading
comprehension, written and oral communication, and critical listening and
thinking. You will participate in learning experiences designed to develop
or refine your basic information literacy skills and cross-cultural awareness.
You will have rich opportunities to develop your ability to engage meaningfully
in dialogue with people whose values, experiences, beliefs, and interests
differ from your own, and to enhance your ability to collaborate with others
in decision-making, learning and completing academic and/or creative activities.
You will learn a great deal about yourself as an individual, community member,
and a cultural and global being.</P>

<P>To guide you academically beyond ProSeminar 100, you will develop a &quot;Learning
Educational Plan,&quot; identifying the knowledge, skills and abilities
required to meet your learning needs at CSUMB, as well as your personal,
social and professional goals. The end result of ProSeminar 100 will be
a portfolio which contains your self-assessment and documentation of projects
completed in ProSeminar 100, along with your Individual Learning Plan (ILP).</P>
