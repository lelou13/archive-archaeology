<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3>What's Expected of You </FONT><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER></P>

<P><B><I>1. Collaboration</I></B></P>

<P>The success of ProSeminar/SBSC 100 depends a great deal upon your contribution.
Much of what we do will require effective collaboration among all of us.
Thus, you need to approach this learning experience in the spirit of collaboration,
with an openness to negotiation and compromise, a willingness to give to
and receive constructive criticism from your colleagues and the instructor.</P>

<P><B><I>2. Attendance</I></B></P>

<P>Effective collaboration in the context of this learning experience requires
your physical presence at each seminar and lab session. We recognize that
occasionally emergencies may force you to miss a session. Whenever possible,
you should inform the instructor in advance of missing a session. You are
responsible for work done and content covered in each session you miss.</P>

<P><B><I>3. Responsibilities to Each Other</I></B></P>

<P>You will be responsible for individually tutoring, mentoring, teaching
and learning from two other students enrolled in this section. During the
first week of the semester we will determine the process for choosing whom
you will work with for the first seven weeks. In week seven we will choose
new partners. In addition to providing helpful responses to their work in
the ProSeminar, you will be responsible for helping them to catch up in
the event they miss a seminar or lab.</P>

<P><B><I>4. Readings</I></B></P>

<P>There is one required reading text for this ProSeminar. <I>Rereading
America: Cultural Contexts for Critical Thinking and Writing</I> is divided
into seven sections, each of which addresses an important &quot;myth&quot;
of American society and culture. We will generally follow the outline of
this reader, unless we as a group negotiate an alternative order. The editors
of this reader have provided alternate groupings for these readings which
we may wish to consider. In order to complete all of the readings in this
text you will need to average approximately 55 pages per week. The standard
for social science and humanities courses is generally 100-125 pages per
week. If you experience difficulties keeping up with the reading it may
indicate that you need to work on improving your reading skills. You should
speak to your instructor about this or seek assistance from the Academic
Skills Achievement Program (ASAP).</P>

<P>You should complete the readings by the date for which they are listed
on the course calendar unless, as a group, we have decided to do something
else.</P>

<P>You or the instructor may suggest alternatives to any of the assigned
readings. We will decide as a group whether to substitute a particular reading,
with the stipulation that the alternative must deal generally with the same
topic and be of approximately the same length.</P>

<P>In addition to the readings in the text, you will read a great deal of
each others' writing. Most of this will occur in lab or seminar. But you
will be expected to read on your own the major essays written by your collaborative
partners.</P>

<P><B><I>5. Writing</I></B></P>

<P>Your writing will generally be closely linked to your reading. Much of
it will be informal. The precise nature of the informal writing will depend
upon what seems to work best for you. Informal writing exercises may include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Prereading exercises in which you write briefly about a topic before
  reading an essay on it;
  <LI>Personal responses to a particular reading;
  <LI>Personal responses to our group discussions of readings;
  <LI>Answering discussion questions from <I>Rereading America</I>;
  <LI>Reporting an event you witnessed or were a part of;
  <LI>Personal statement about, or response to, an issue on campus or in
  the larger society;
  <LI>Responses to, and suggestions for improving, essays written by your
  peers.
</UL>

<P>The formal writing sometimes will be in the style of analytical and expository
essays that characterize writing in the social and behavioral sciences.
Others, such as your autobiography, may be in a more narrative or story-telling
style. These will include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Autobiography</FONT><FONT COLOR="#003399"> </FONT>(to
  become an introduction to your Individual Learning Plan);
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Mini-Web &amp; Journal Research Essay</FONT><FONT
   COLOR="#0000FF"> </FONT>on a topic in the social and behavioral sciences
  (Collaborative);
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Census Research Essay</FONT> on the Monterey
  Bay Region (Collaborative);
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Report on Field Trip</FONT> to Monterey County
  Historical Society (collaborative);
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Position Essay</FONT> on a topic related to a
  project which the group will decide upon by Monday, September 8;
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Individual Learning Plan</FONT>;
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Evaluations of Collaboration Skills</FONT>.
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#3366CC">Synthesis Essay</FONT> bringing together, connecting
  and synthesizing in an analytical essay the content and conclusions of
  your Autobiography, Position Essay, Field Trip Report, Mini-Web &amp; Journal
  Research Essay, and Census Research;
</UL>

<P><B><I>6. Oral Communication</I></B></P>

<P>Informal:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>You will be expected to participate in organized group discussions
  in seminars and labs. We will focus both on the readings and on topics
  which we as a group choose. This will include conversations we will have
  in the first two weeks to decide on a group service project related to
  the University-wide ProSeminar theme of <B>&quot;Building a Multicultural
  Campus Community.&quot;</B>
</UL>

<P>Formal:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>You will make a formal presentation to the group which reports either
  on a specific aspect of the group service project (with the goal of persuading
  your audience that the project either was or was not valuable to you or
  those for whom the service was rendered), or presents an argument for the
  conclusions in your Synthesis Essay. The presentation will be 8-10 minutes.
</UL>

<P><B><I>7. </I><A HREF="portfolio.html">Portfolio</A></B></P>

<P>Formal written work for ProSeminar/SBSC 100 may be submitted in first
draft by e-mail to the instructor. Final versions, however, must be in hardcopy
and submitted in a portfolio. Your informal writings should be included
in the portfolio in their original forms.</P>
