<P>Your instructors have provided a weekly calendar which you should use
to keep track of the time you spend working on ProSeminar/SBSC 100 activities.
It will be best for you to block out chunks of time each week during which
you will work on this learning experience.</P>

<P>A generally accepted standard for the amount of time you should plan
to spend outside of class on your academic work is two hours for every hour
in class. This translates into eight (8) hours per week that you should
plan to spend outside of class working on your ProSeminar/SBSC 100 activities.
You should keep a record of how much time you actually require outside of
class in order to keep up. You may find that you are able complete your
outside class activities in fewer than eight hours a week. In that case
you will be able to budget your time accordingly. On the other hand, if
you find you require more than eight hours per week to keep up with assignments,
you should bring the record of your weekly schedule, indicating the time
you have spent working on ProSeminar/SBSC 100, to your instructor, who will
negotiate a revised plan of assignments with you.<BR>
