<P><B><I>1. Collaboration</I></B></P>

<P>The foundation of CSUMB's educational philosophy is that we &quot;all
learn from and teach one another in an atmosphere of mutual respect.&quot;
This means that your instructors approach this learning experience in the
spirit of collaboration, with an openness to negotiation and compromise
and a willingness to hear constructive criticism from you.<BR>
</P>

<P><B><I>2. Attendance</I></B></P>

<P>Effective collaboration requires the physical presence of your instructor
at each lab and seminar session. While occasionally emergencies or may force
us to miss a session, whenever possible your instructor will inform you
in advance should he need to be absent. Every effort will be made to ensure
that any absences by your instructor do not result in a greater burden on
you. Tardiness by anyone is an insult to those who arrived on time. Your
instructor is committed to respecting your promptness by being in class
at the scheduled hour.</P>

<P><B><I>3. Office Hours and Appointments</I></B></P>

<P>Your instructor's office hours are indicated on the SBSC 100 <A HREF=
"home.html">Home Page</A>. This is a commitment to be available to you,
and the other students enrolled in his classes on a first-come first-served
basis during that time unless you are given advance notice that he will
be unable to hold announced office hours. In the latter case, alternative
times will be made available to you. You may also make appointments with
your instructor at times other than the announced office hours. Your instructor
is committed to honoring such appointments when he has agreed to them.</P>

<P><B><I>4. Readings</I></B></P>

<P>You may expect your instructor to have done all of the assigned reading
for this learning experience and to hold himself to the same deadlines that
apply to you.</P>

<P><B><I>5. Reading, Commenting on and Returning Written Material</I></B></P>

<P>Your instructor will read and comment on writing that you have turned
in to him with the same care and thoroughness that he expects you to put
into your writing. Normally, you may expect your formal essays to be returned
to you within two weeks from the dates on which you submit them. Should
unforeseen circumstances make this impossible, the instructor will inform
you before the end of the two-week period and negotiate with you a reasonable
alternative date for the return of your work.</P>

<P><B><I>6. Interpersonal Relations</I></B></P>

<P>You may expect your instructor to treat you with fairness in grading
and with respect both in group settings and in private conferences.</P>

<P>Your instructor will refrain from acts or words that would intentionally
humiliate or embarrass you in front of your peers. Should he embarrass or
humiliate you unintentionally, he hopes that you will immediately inform
him of the effects of his words or actions on you so that he may become
more sensitive in the future.</P>

<P>Your instructor will be your ally in class in the event one or more of
your peers should attack you unfairly or embarrass or humiliate you.</P>

<P>You may expect your instructor to respect differences of gender, sexual
orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, learning styles, abilities and political
views without privileging some over others.</P>
