<P>A portfolio is the final physical product of this learning experience.
The complete portfolio will be the primary basis for assigning you a grade
in ProSeminar/SBSC 100. (Your participation in group discussions and projects
will be the secondary basis for your grade.) The essential components of
your portfolio are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A three-ring loose-leaf binder with an outer clear plastic cover under
  which you will insert a cover- or title-page;
  <LI>Cover/title-page that identifies the name and number of the learning
  experience, your name, the instructor's name, the name of this university,
  and the semester and year in which you did the work. You are free to be
  creative with this page, but it is important that you communicate the essential
  information effectively;
  <LI>Your Individual Learning Plan (ILP);
  <LI>The final paper version of each thing you have written in ProSeminar/SBSC
  100;
  <LI>Tab dividers identifying each formal essay and sections categorizing
  your informal writing.
  <LI>You will have peer comments on first drafts of each of your formal
  essays. Place these immedately following the final draft of each.
  <LI>Weekly Schedule of Time Spent Outside Class on SBSC/Proseminar 100

<P>Formal writing:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Each essay must have a title that appears at the top of the first page
  of text;
  <LI>An essay that has more than five mechanical errors (i.e., those of
  grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization) on any page will be considered
  incomplete;
  <LI>Essays must be written on a word processor using a standard size (10-12
  pt) and style font. Script or italics are acceptable only for indicating
  titles of books, journals or films, or to emphasize short passages;
  <LI>You should use side margins of approximately one inch and top and bottom
  margins of 3/4 to one inch;
  <LI>Use a good quality laser or ink-jet printer and a standard quality
  white paper;
  <LI>You must cite sources for all ideas that are not original with you
  and all information that you do not know from personal, first-hand experience;
  <LI>Citations must conform to standard formats acceptable in the field
  or discipline within which you are writing. For example, anthropologists
  and sociologists use an MLA parenthetical format and a list of works cited,
  while historians use traditional footnotes or endnotes. Each of the acceptable
  formats is explained in Hacker, <I>A Pocket Style Manual</I>. You may find
  more detail on how historians use footnotes and endnotes in Rampolla, <I>A
  Pocket Guide to Writing in History</I>. You will find additional guidance
  to help you properly cite internet sources by searching the CSUMB Library
  web page, or by going to http://www.wiredstyle.com from netscape.
</UL>

<P>Informal Writing:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Writing that you did in long-hand during a seminar session may be placed
  in the portfolio as is;
  <LI>Writing that you did on a computer during lab session should be printed
  out and placed in the portfolio. In some cases, you will have first and
  last drafts as a result of in-class rewriting. Include both drafts.
