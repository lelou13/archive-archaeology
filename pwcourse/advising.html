<P><B>The Seal Server:</B> You may e-mail your questions and requests for
advising via the FirstClass Instranet student e-mail accounts available
to you. The "SBSC Classes" (e.g., SBSC 348) "drop folder" located on the
"Seal Server" provides an on-line location for depositing assignments and
deliverables, and the SBSC Peer Counselors are available at Building 17
for your assistance.

<P><B>Important Notice:</B> When submitting deliverables and other assignments
via the internet, please provide a clear and complete identification label
for your submissions. For example: Joan Doe, who is registered in the lower
division portion of the Fall 2001 SBSC 348 class, and who is submitting
Major Deliverable 2&nbsp; (in MacIntosh computer format), might title her
e-mail submission and attachment as follows: <B>sbsc348.doe.F98.md2</B>
(upper or lower case letters are acceptable).&nbsp; Anyone using a Pentium
or IBM-clone may abbreviate to <B>348m2doe.doc.&nbsp; </B><I>Any </I>assignment
<I>that </I>does <I>not </I>contain <I>the </I>title and or&nbsp; <I>format
</I>in <I>question </I>will <I>not </I>be <I>accepted </I>for <I>evaluation</I>.

<P>All electronic submissions should be dropped into the "Class Folder"
specific to the section within which you are enrolled: i.e., SBSC 248 submissions
should be dropped in the SBSC 248 <B>Classes Folder</B>, whereas SBSC 348
students will submit their assignments in the SBSC 348 Classes Folder.

<P><B>Questions:</B>&nbsp; Please feel free to ask questions or request
assistance from your professor during or after class, or from any of the
Peer Counselors available in Building 17.
