<b><font color="#FFFFFF">The town of San Juan Bautista, California,
is located three miles east of Highway 101, approximately 45 minutes by
automobile southeast of San Jose, California.&nbsp; Founded as a Euro-American
town on June 24, 1797 by Franciscan Padre Fray Fermin Francisco de Lasuen,
the town was situated adjacent to the pre-existing Mutsune (Ohlone/Costanoan)
village of Popeloutchom.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The original inhabitants of the San Juan Valley&nbsp;
were the Mutsune, who have been identified as a branch of the larger Ohlone
or Costanoan cultural and linguistic group of the central and northern
coasts of California.&nbsp; Original settlements consisted of thatch-covered
structures with rock-lined hearths and utensils ranging from groundstone
mortars and pestles to arrowheads and related stone tools.&nbsp; Other
related peoples in the region are known to have occupied the region over
5,000 years before the present.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The center of town is situated about the Old
Mission of San Juan Bautista, which was built over the earliest buildings
erected by the Spaniards and Mutsune at the site of Popeloutchom.&nbsp;
Though the earliest constructions began in 1797, the main quadrangle that
dominated much of the mission period, is largely gone.&nbsp; Constructed
in its earliest phase in 1800, and expanded in 1810, 1812, and 1816, the
quadrangle and convento were the heart of early mission life.&nbsp; The
Old Mission, which has undergone many phases of construction and reconstruction,
remains a focal point of community activity.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The state park, and plaza, and the many of
the remaining 19th century buildings that surround the Plaza, date from
the early to mid-1800's.&nbsp; Many of the family names associated with
these early California buildings are still important names within the community
life of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; It is for the preservation of the histories
of these early California families, and many of the descendants and later
settlers of the San Juan Valley, that the San Juan Bautista Historical
Society was formed.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">If you would like to contribute to this effort,
please do contact us with your family information.&nbsp; We would eventually
like to build a complete history of the community life of San Juan Bautista.</font></b>
