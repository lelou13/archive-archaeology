<b><font color="#FFFFFF">The Carl Luck Museum is still very much a work
in progress.&nbsp; Originally proposed in the 1970's by members of the
newly chartered San Juan Bautista Historical Society, the museum's development
has been envisioned from the start as a community museum for this town
long known as the "City of History."&nbsp; Despite early planning and discussion
on what the museum would become, the museum's development has hinged on
the availability of space, community donations, and the Carl Luck Filling
Station building located adjacent the Luck Library of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Spring of 1999, the museum received a real boost in the form of
permissions to occupy the Carl Luck Filling Station, and the assistance
of the Gabilan Conservation Camp crews of Soledad under the direction of
Lt. Commander Flavio Silva and Dr. Ruben Mendoza of the CSU Monterey Bay
Museum Education Project.&nbsp; While permission was obtained from the
City of San Juan Bautista to occupy the filling station, the men of the
Gabilan Conservation Camp set about gutting the building and removing the
trash that had accumulated therein.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Since that time, work has steadily progressed
on the renovation of the interior of the proposed museum space.&nbsp; In
addition to the concrete patching of the building provided by volunteer
Mr. Patrick MacDonald of Patrick MacDonald Masonry of Fresno, California,
the interiors have been painted and the doors and windows have been replaced
under the supervision of Mr. Joe Columber of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Ms.
Georgiana Gularte of the San Juan Bautista historical society has coordinated
all recent efforts to install ceiling fans, electrical wiring, and walkways.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">In the Fall of 1999, the students of the CSU
Monterey Bay Museum Education Project under the supervision of Dr. Ruben
Mendoza have worked to organize, catalog, digitize and post materials to
this site in an effort to create an online or virtual museum presence for
this fledgling museum and important historical society.&nbsp; This effort
has been conducted as a service learning project for the purposes of making
this community's history a history for the community.&nbsp; We do hope
that you enjoy this site and keep track of its ongoing development over
the coming year.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
