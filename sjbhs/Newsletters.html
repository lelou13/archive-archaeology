<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">150th Anniversary of Statehood</font></u></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">On September 9th, 2000, California will celebrate
150 years of statehood.&nbsp; In keeping with this special year our quarterly
program themes (March, June and September) will reflect the local history
leading up to statehood.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">For centuries the western wilderness was populated
by natives who knew nothing of European culture.&nbsp; However, in 1769
the impact of European influence was felt by the establishment of the first
Spanish mission at San Diego.&nbsp; Led by Spanish soldiers and Fray Junipero
Serra, Franciscan missionary, Spain invaded California.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Father Serra, was a strong leader and Presidente
of missions.&nbsp; After his death Father Fermin Lasuen was appointed Presidente.&nbsp;
It was during his administration that Mission San Juan Bautista was established
in 1797.&nbsp; After the death of Lasuen, Father Estevan Tapis was appointed
Presidente.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The theme of our March meeting will be the
life of Father Tapis and his direct impact on Mission San Juan Bautista.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where he was buried??</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Carla [brilliant as ever] has initiated a date
switch--not reflected in the Chamber Calendar,though.&nbsp; Member meetings
held on the first Saturday&nbsp; of March, June, September, and December.&nbsp;
June 3 Noon--VFW Hall; a Caetano&nbsp; BBQ&nbsp;&nbsp; `$10.00</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Participants have enjoyed the last several
meetings so much that they lingered with friends for hours.&nbsp; Suan
of the Crane House and the Native Daughters are still raving about the
success--success in terms of time to visit, gather new members and ideas,
and for us over $600.00 in donations from enthusiasts.&nbsp; All of which
keep us on track--doing the best we can......</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">Board Change: Caetano, Director</font></u></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard Caetano has graciously accepted a position
on the Board.&nbsp; He will be filling the vacancy left by Barbara Franco,
whose help with the launching of the Luck Museum and the many other projects
in the past several years is missed!&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet the 3rd Thursday
at noon at Jardines--no change in that.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">Guest Book on Internet....</font></u></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">On your computer, this Historian and the last
two are on the Internet at the address above. View the team and the lab.
I can’t quit smiling about our connection with Ruben and the University
after reading the comments from viewers in Guest Book.&nbsp; Join us there.&nbsp;
I am proud of my years of commitment to our Luck Museum, for it may inspire
someone to walk through life educating and doing good for others in the
steps of Dr. Ruben Mendoza.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">What’s the Progress with our Luck?</font></u></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">As you may have already read in the Guest Book
on the Internet, installing the phone and security, sealing the concrete,
and moving in are happening now. We are scheduling a paint-the-window-frames
day in early February.&nbsp; The heat pump takes moisture out of the air;
volunteers are needed to dig the dirt away from the perimeter where moisture
creeps in.&nbsp; The mouse entrance holes will be framed over and best
of all Joe Cullumber says he’s donating a five drawer fire file--complete
with its contents.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">We had the pleasure of meeting Doris Perry
Fox when she came to Joe’s and delivered the items Louise left to us.&nbsp;
The class pictures took our immediate interest.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Valerie Egland has prepared sketches for the
Luck Museum sign, a gift from Ann Winn in memory of her mother Drucilla
Isaacson, our Charter Member.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Claudia Fisher, our member and Native Daughter
you met in December, has prepared a display of NDGW historic scrapbooks
and memorabilia at SouthValley Bank to celebrate the NDGW San Juan Parlor’s
90th birthday on Feb. 23. In City Hall our files supplied photos of the
move of the Post Office--5years ago!&nbsp; When you are there, please take
time to look into the main room where the mural(s) of Rebecca Stone and
the San Juan school children several years ago is displayed.&nbsp; The
theme of each panel is the theme Carla has chosen for our programs this
year.&nbsp; [I know I keep mentioning the murals, but if you haven’t seen
them, you are missing a very important chronicle of our history]; those
children will be proud for their entire lives because a teacher helped
them see San Juan for what it really is “San Juan City of History.” All
organizations uphold this theme and work toward updating and keeping San
Juan, not only historic, but alive. Today is history, too.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">SJBHS and City support Librarian Larkin</font></u></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The City Council of San Juan Bautista has put
its full support behind this Luck Library and Museum with staff assistance,
cooperative arrangements, encouragement and money.&nbsp; We thank the Council
and urge all members and friends to show appreciation by volunteering just
four hours a month.&nbsp; Dr. Larkin has put the local history section
of the Library right behind the check out desk where it is safe and available
for research.&nbsp; Some books may be checked out.&nbsp; She has also displayed
books we have for sale (and the Chamber office has authors Clough, the
Mylar, Lydon for sale too.)&nbsp; Dr. Larkin has joined with Aromas and
the school libraries to form a consortium which will enable us to develop
a “digital museum” giving us access to all of the materials in all of the
libraries.&nbsp; This “digital museum” combined with our “hands-on” artifacts
and information will encourage the habit of “life-long learning” when visiting
San Juan Bautista.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Expanding and improving our facilities will
be made possible IF Proposition 14 is passed by Californians in March.&nbsp;
Every effort is being made by those of us in San Benito County to encourage
a positive result.&nbsp; We are going to the Board of Supervisors and the
Council for support.&nbsp; Our hopes are up; please join us by doing whatever
you can.&nbsp; Information is available at any library.</font></b><b><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">And don’t miss the chance to participate in
the activities going on in the Luck Library:&nbsp; the success of Tell
me more Ancestor Stories, Grandma author D.Dennet’s visit Feb.1, encourages
us to ask Regina Phelan to come sometime.&nbsp; We have purchased two sets
of her wonderful young person series on California. But most of all the
best activity is Pat Larkin herself.&nbsp; Come, visit!&nbsp;&nbsp; Newsletter:

<br><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;By Program Chairperson V.P. Carla Hendershot</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Larry Cain will be our guest speaker for
the General meeting on Saturday, December 4th.&nbsp; Mr. Cain will talk
about the Service Club, which has served the citizens of San Juan Bautista
for over 70 years.&nbsp; The organization has raised funds for many civic
projects -- Scouting programs, repairing the Community Hall, and sponsoring
the annual pre-Christmas bonfire, a long standing tradition in San Juan
Bautista.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">You are invited to bring any memorabilia about
the Service Club.&nbsp; Mr. Cain is currently gathering this information
for the benefit of the Service Club and the Historical Society.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Be sure to attend the luncheon and House Tour

<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">Public Welcomed at Vintage Homes</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The Native Daughters of the Golden West at
The Adobe Home&nbsp; 203 4th Street and Susan Brady at The Crane House&nbsp;
401 Second&nbsp; at Polk Street are open to the public for tours and refreshments
by 1:30 Dec. 4th.&nbsp; According to Charles Clough in SAN JUAN BAUTISTA
The Town, The Mission, The Park, The Native Daughters' Adobe Home, originally
the Pico Adobe, was purchased and restoration begun by 1936 which was 100
years after it was built by Ralph Pico, a Basque sheep raiser and builder.
Crane House (1835) is credited with being the first wood frame house in
California built by Americans -— by the McMahon family who visited there
last year.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">These two homes and the Service Club are written
about in Clough's chapters, "And the Town Moved On" and "Community Spirit."&nbsp;
Lee Gularte, Soledad, Monterey County Historical Advisory Commissioner,
will display some of her vintage fashions in both homes.&nbsp; Refreshments
will be available for a $2.00 raffle ticket purchased at either Home.&nbsp;
Raffle prize will be a Sleznick Bicentennial card.&nbsp; Winner will receive
it by mail.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Native Daughters will display and have for
sale items designed especially for them by another local artist Valerie
Egland who trained with Alex Zeller.&nbsp; The Society will have for sale
the cards and the books we sell.&nbsp; Both the Luck Library and the Luck
Museum will be open for visitors to view all of the changes going on in
this the last months of the last year of the 20th Century.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The general public is invited to attend any
and all of these activities.&nbsp; Our Luncheon is at noon on Dec. 4th
and the Homes are open 1 - 4 pm.&nbsp; Chamber of Commerce Merchants' Holiday
Open House and the State Park Living History Day are that first Saturday,
too.&nbsp; The Service Club Bonfire is December 17th.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">Vintage Photos and More on Internet</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The changes in the Library are phenomenal.&nbsp;
The shelves in the check-out corner are to be the Local History section.&nbsp;
Space is there for the many books members have promised to give us when
we "have a place."&nbsp; Now is the time; we have the place. Mrs. Ron Olmstead
is still trying to get the Bancroft Index.&nbsp; The Native Daughters have
purchased history books suitable for the juvenile readers.&nbsp; The Library
Auxiliary Barbecue was a success; that money will be used to stock the
library; all of the used-book sales goes to the Auxiliary, too.&nbsp; Patrons
are buying books as they never have before; they are in the Library foyer
for anyone to peruse and purchase.&nbsp; Since much of our material is
out-of-print or one-of-a-kind hand-written documents, donations are our
only source for that information which is being welcomed into the Library
itself for patron use.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Occasionally, when I am in the Library, a student
needs something from the Bancroft bookcase for a report on the Missions.&nbsp;
That precious look of a 4th grader as she/he handles the over-one-hundred-year-old
Bancroft book, and the other "artifacts" in the drawer is worth every volunteer
moment I have to spend.&nbsp; Come to think of it, the parents helping
them are probably not 35 years old and are thrilled to use the old books,
too.&nbsp; I can't resist telling them the story of Dr. Ruben Mendoza who
came here as a fourth grader and was inspired to be the person he is today.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">To become Vintage Oral Histories</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">In the Library each week from 4-6 Thursdays,
Dr. Mendoza arrives from CSU Monterey Bay with student Carolina Victoria
Sordia, a huge camcorder, and a tiny brand-new hand-held digital camcorder--to
record/film our "vintage" personalities under the direction of Carla Hendershot.&nbsp;
On tape are Joe Cullumber, Leonard Caetano, Bonnie and Kenny Laverone,
Bud and Renee Holthouse, and Enos Silva. These oral histories are added
to those who were able to talk last year in the Mission series, Mary Sellen,
being only one. Interviews take place in the middle of the Library activities
area where we also have Louise Perry and John Baumgartner on tape. Carla
plans to add a history/interviewee every class meeting in the next year.&nbsp;
We can see Carolina Victoria's graduate work next May at the "Capstone
Festival." and on the Internet as soon as possible.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The students', Ted Richter and Vahina Buduoani,
and our work is slow-going because each vintage photo has to be taken from
its file, and plastic folder where it has been for the past six (to 36)
years, given a "fresh" accession number, photocopied, that photocopy numbered,
annotated using research material available in the Pearce and Clough books,
punched, put into a binder; the original "vintage" print scanned, and put
back into its plastic holder, and refiled.&nbsp; We can use some volunteer
help to while away a rainy afternoon.&nbsp; After being scanned, the students
enter the data, i.e. the annotations and any other information we want
on it for the Internet.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">From the Internet [is that capitalized?], we
will be able to share our materials with who ever asks.&nbsp; The image
on the computer screen is not "sharp" enough for reproduction; that will
be the potential moneymaker for us--selling the "sharper" prints for a
fee to be decided.&nbsp; We are going to need regular help with this museum
project.&nbsp; It's been in the hands of a few of us so far; we need more
hands for the future.&nbsp; Vintage is good, but so is a fresh start with
fresh faces, and hands.&nbsp; Can you give us your help?&nbsp;&nbsp; A
look at what's going on can be found on the San Juan Bautista Historical
Society’s portion of Dr. Mendoza's web site which is located at:</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">Vintage Hands Keep Working and Sharing</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Volunteers have painted the back Luck Museum
rooms and washed--almost--all the windows.&nbsp; The Rotary Club is going
to finish the painting.&nbsp; Sentry Alarms System is providing the security.&nbsp;
Enterprise Electric donated the fan.&nbsp; Valerie Egland is working on
a layout for the sign which Anne Winn is donating in memory of her mother
Drucilla Issacson, Charter Member.&nbsp; We have most of the office kinds
of things.&nbsp; We need mundane things like a broom, dust pan, waste baskets,
paper towels, instant coffee, cups, Windex, chairs, a meeting table, a
six foot ladder...You can bring them to our meeting.&nbsp; And did I say....help...</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Bonnie Laverone brought the gift of Nonnie
Bonnifacino--the doorbell from the Luck Victorian.&nbsp; Chris Warren stopped
me on the street to exclaim her delight at meeting the Pearce family who
has a video of the San Juan Canyon to share.&nbsp; Pepe Espinoza showed
me a trunk which is pictured in the Pearce East of the Gavilans while Ted
Thoeney, Native Daughters' newest Sister, and I were trying to save some
of deAnza Adobe treasures from the rain coming through the "roof."&nbsp;
Gas Station memorabilia, we do need.&nbsp; The Horleys will know how to
help with that. [A deed is ready for donors.]</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The City is not planning to do any landscape
changes until next year; but Harvey Sandoval is already thinking..&nbsp;
That's when the Luck Library may get a face lift--outside--to match the
lift inside--the Larkin Lift.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Don't miss the fun we've been having when the
Program Chairperson calls on all of us to share our memories; guests are
taking notes!</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Enthusiasm for our Christmas event began several
weeks ago with a phone call from new member Jo Harth from Morro Bay. She
made reservations for herself and her husband for the luncheon so she could
be sure to see the Crane House.&nbsp; I had met her in the Library when
they came to find information on the cemetery where they had seen that
strange "wood grave marker".....[It's been 4 years; we have Richard to
thank for his keeping the Society together since its Charter in 1965 and
giving it a home for years, too.]</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Reservations are needed.&nbsp; We could use
some homemade cookie volunteers too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us know if you can
bring cookies and/or come to lunch.&nbsp; Carla says, call her, leave your

its final sales days for those who want them. The Cravea family gave us
the Liar’s Bench for our Museum. (Alas, Josephine is now gone, too.) Of
course, it is Bud and Rene Holthouse who actually picked up the Bench and
are storing it for us.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Look forward after lunch to Barbara Franco
and Joe Cullumber sharing with us the progress of the Museum as we inspect
it. Weather permitting we will have our dessert there—remembering the 1999
birthdays. An update on the Luck Museum finds that we have used and/or
committed the $19,000 the Library Auxiliary has been donated&nbsp; to this
tremendous cause.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Look forward to hearing the progress we are
making toward the 21st Century with the help of students from Dr. Ruben
Mendoza’s class who are working with us to prepare our materials for the
Museum opening this year and beyond. We start the classes at the Library
Thursday September 2nd at 4pm in the storeroom.&nbsp; With his help we
will discover how to copy materials so that the owners can keep the originals
if they wish, We will catalogue information on where materials may be found
so that we become a living bibliography for researchers. We do not believe
in doing the research, that would take away their fun.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Look forward to touring the Luck Library where
the new Director Pat Larkin has initiated many changes-not the least of
which is that the Library is open 6 days a week.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">New Library Hours:&nbsp; Mon. 2-6&nbsp; Tu.
10-8 Wed. 10-6&nbsp; Th. 12-8&nbsp; Fri. 10-6&nbsp; Sat. 9-5</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">New Programs are to be initiated with the aid
of volunteers—as&nbsp; we come forward to make the dreams come true. City
residents will be asked to respond to a questionaire.. {If you don’t live
here, let someone know what you would hope can happen at the whole Luck
Library and Museum Park. Send us a comment so we can include all ideas.}</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">September 25th……..and……Beyond………</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Mark your calendars for the annual Auxiliary
fund raiser for the Luck Library—Chicken BBQ under the management of Member
Leonard Caetano and Crew is served September 25th, 1999 from 4:30-7:30
at the VFW Hall. Take out available, home-delivery&nbsp; to shut-ins, and
Raffle of donated items from sponsors merchants&nbsp; and friend in town.
Tickets at the Library..$10…half is your donation.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Editors comment:] I, for one, feel that I
am forever grateful to the Auxiliary; the Historical Society is the beneficiary
of the years of Auxiliary members’ faithful work… During the years those
funds were growing, the Auxiliary also put many hours into raising funds
for the books and materials to augment the Budget of the Coty which is
the sole sponsor of the Luck Library. Now, with Nora Conte and Pat Larkin
at the helm grants are being sought. This BBQ will benefit the Library.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Our support will help say Thank You to the
Auxiliary and the City for keeping the doors open. Volunteers are appreciated
in the Library in any capacity. The Saturday hours will coincide with our
Museum hours so that users may access both buildings and materials on their
visits. The Library has launched a campaign to strengthen the California
research section where we will house some of our materials so that they
will be available during all of the Library hours under the Librarians’
supervision (yes, Librarians’ two are on the job at all times.)&nbsp; It
is toward this end that a couple of us from the Historical Society got
together and initiated the volunteer effort. The Library was closed to
the public most of the week as an opportunity to weed the shelves and hold
a book sale for the City.&nbsp; Several of us donated over 431 hours to
this cause: and will continue to volunteer in the Library as our time allows.
This weeding… as it turns out,… was a required first step before applying
for a grant.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Look forward, Does it sound as if we are ready
to say “Guess what we have in store for you?”</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">It is with the pleasure we get from volunteering
in mind, that, at the Society Board Meeting in July, we asked Barbara Franco
to write about volunteering in our next newsletter. She should know…while
we were at the Library, she was shouldering the Luck Station repair work
[while also chairing the Mission Fiesta in its effort to raise the $12,000
it did this year.]</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">We enjoyed hearing about “the spirit of San
Juan” at Dona Esther last March when 35 of us sat down to our membership
meeting with many familiar faces in the community coming to our luncheon
for the first time. “San Juan turns out.” Year after year, after year.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">When you tell us what you have “in store for
us,” remember, it’s not just your artifacts and information we need, it’s
your time, too. Keep us in mind as you plan your activities for the years
to come. We are not forgetting the several members and other community
spirited people who have already said they will help in any way they can.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">December meeting – We have been invited back
to The Crane House by Proprietor Susan Brady. We are looking for other
homes to visit as well. Suggestions? We look forward……..</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you can use these statistics about
it. We had 76 members last year; and 54 so far this year with 2 renewed
through next year, two—too---to---2001. The Newsletter goes out to 150
people, at least, either by mail or hand delivery. Among the Organizations
that get the letter are the VFW, VFW Auxiliary, the Native Daughters, the
Chamber, the County Historical Society, the Mission, the State Park. We
know that other recipients share with their organizations,--so one of the
things you can do for the Society is talk about it. When you have question
and/or comments—good, bad, indifferent, let us know. Constructive criticism
is good—especially at this time when so many changes are being made.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday, Member Harvey Sandoval and I walked
around the Luck Museum site and gathered our thoughts on the master plan
for landscaping. This would include his idea for re-creating the San Juan
Central in the park and placing the Jim Jack cabin near it. We talked about
where to put the sign that we have a member contribution for; he’s in the
landscaping business. I talked again with Chuck Wood who will spear-head
the Jim Jack’s cabin reroofing. Although, he is busy starting a new business
for the State of California, he is still willing to volunteer his time.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">We are concerned about the lone pear tree left
standing below the mission. It was brought to our attention thanks to a
photo sent to us by Edie Franz, Proprietor of the Fault Line in the Breen
house on Franklin St.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">We are slowly but surely getting all of the15
file drawers in order to be placed in the Luck Station. Joe and Frank Luchelli,
and Ken Laverone are thinking of redoing the inventory of who lives/works
in each building. These community members help us know that the community
will be ready so when asked to help with the next phase of providing for
our needs as the Luck Museum opens its doors. .</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Our goals are clear…..</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">We Look forward as a research organization
in search of materials that help people in their research, and … as a museum
where artifacts can be shared in our displays.</font></b>
