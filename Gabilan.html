<br>Since the Fall of 1996, Lt. Flavio Silva and the men of the Gabilan
Conservation Camp, #38, and the Institute of Archaeology of CSU Monterey
Bay have engaged a joint effort to restore Old Mission San Juan Bautista,
California. This effort, which began as a collaboration between the Institute
and the Camp has evolved into a long term effort to restore and enhance
the Old Mission and its museum.
<p>In addition, the Institute and a number of community volunteers, under
the joint direction of Professor Ruben Mendoza (Director, CSUMB Institute
of Archaeology) and Lt. Flavio Silva (Camp Commander, GCC#38) have partnered
to provide the men of the camp with diverse opportunities to engage in
a program of hands-on historic preservation and archaeological explorations.
Ms. Brenda Pobre, CSUMB graduate student assistant, longterm volunteer,
and program coordinator of the Gabilan Conservation Camp Education Program
has been instrumental in obtaining support for this collaborative venture.
In addition to coordinating the collection of contributions for the week
to week needs of the restoration project, Ms. Pobre has taught classes
at the camp and mentored Gabilan Camp "Straight Forward" program members.
<p>The "Straight Forward" program provides community outreach, service,
and gang intervention services for the communities of the Central Coast.
