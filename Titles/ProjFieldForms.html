The success of any archaeological lab and field experience requires that all members 
of the crew function as a team. As such, both the Participation Log, and the Activity 
Log are used as one means by which to measure your participation and engagement 
during the lab and field experience.

Field Journals, and a well prepared body of field notes, are a key outcome expected

projects. The following guide is intended to provide some basis for assessing 
your progress in producing the type of field notes anticipated by your professor.

The final lab and field report should accurately and effectively convey that information 
deemed critical to providing a technical description of the archaeological site, 
excavation features, and related units of analysis. The effort to make good on 
the use of the scientific method requires that such reports follow a specified 
format. That format specified here is specific to that required to producing a 
lab report summarizing methods and observations:<br>

The timely and accurate completion of any and all Specimens Data Entry forms will 
insure that those specimens recovered on any given field day will be converted 
into useful data for subsequent analysis and interpretation. Your failure to properly 
and completely input that data requested on the Field Specimen Catalog Cards or 
the Field Specimens Catalog may well result in the irretrievable loss of data. 
The Format Guidelines and Field Specimen Data Entry Form provided here are therefore 
crucial guides to your accurate and consistent entry of any and all data:

<hr WIDTH="100%">The release and waiver forms are required of students
enrolled in any class or project-related activity that requires lab or
field time.&nbsp; The liability waiver is required for all students and
is one way of acknowledging that project-related precautions and potential
hazards have been reviewed by the instructor and student.&nbsp; The multimedia
release is the equivalent of a "photo release" in that it permits Dr. Ruben
Mendoza and the Institute of Archaeology to use images of you, produced
in lab or field contexts, for the purposes of publication or multimedia.&nbsp;
