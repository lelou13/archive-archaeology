<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> You should note that each of the following SBSC
Major Learning Outcomes and CSUMB University Learning Requirements are
addressed in part by specific deliverables and lab and field assignments
that are required of participants in this Virtual Learning Lab in Technical
Imaging. Please consider these learning outcomes and requirements as you
plan your projects and work toward the completion of your respective contributions
to this learning experience. Further information on each and every one
of these outcomes is available in published form in the 1996/1997 CSUMB
Catalog.

<h3>
SBSC Major Learning Outcomes</h3></center>
The following Major Learning Requirements or MLO's are specific to the
learning outcomes required of all Social and Behavioral Sciences majors
at the California State University Monterey Bay. These Major Learning Outcomes
include:
<p><b>SBSC Area 1</b> (Theory; e.g. Demonstrated ability to understand,
recognize, and apply social science concepts and approaches in the examination
and study of cultural and societal developments in all times and places)
<p><b>SBSC Area 2</b> (Information Management, Data Retrieval, and Analysis;
e.g. demonstated skills in managing and qualitatively interpreting that
information specific to photographic and cultural materials that serve
to document case studies borne of specific community studies)
<p><b>SBSC Area 3</b> (Specialized Competencies in the Social Sciences;
e.g. demonstrated development of skills in the use of principles and methods
drawn from visual anthropology and archaeological photography for the purposes
of producing photographic documentation specific to ethnographic and archaeological
studies of the Salinas Valley of central California)
<center>
<h3>
CSUMB University Learning Requirements</h3></center>
The following CSUMB University Learning Requirements are more fully addressed
in the CSUMB 1996/1997 Catalog. It should be noted that each of these outcomes
is addressed in part by the various deliverables and in the form of the
final term project that you will submit for final assessment within this
Virtual Learning Lab.
<p><b>ARTSCOM </b>(The ability to demonstrate an understanding of how the
arts affect cultural preservation or change while at the same time producing
a work of art that communicates to a diverse audience; e.g. production
of a photographic essay complete with sufficient caption information and
thematic focus so as to document the plight of the homeless and or elderly
in a rural community of the Central Coast)
<p><b>CP </b>(Demonstrate by way of written, oral, or media reflection
on your direct service experience in a community the development of the
skills and ability to: (a) identify and understand the socioeconomic and
cultural issues underlying communities and their resources; (b) enter and
exit communities appropriately and respectfully; (c) comprehend community-identified
assets and needs from community-defined perspectives; and finally, (d)
analyze these assets and needs in their broader institutional and social
context; e.g. production of a photographic essay and field journal based
on a study of the oldest families residing within the community of San
Juan Bautista)
<p><b>CULT</b> (The ability to compare and contrast one's own culture of
origin with that of another culture, particularly as this pertains to those
relationships that obtain between a culture's historical, aesthetic, and
material context, and its values and lifestyles; e.g. production of a photographic
essay accompanied by a typewritten text and oral presentation that provides
a point of reflection on the subculture of Mexican American street gang
members, particularly if the group studied is different and distinct from
your own)
<p><b>ENGCOM</b> (Ability to demonstrate empathic and critical listening
skills, production of a written text, and oral communication of a complex
idea to an audience; e.g. an oral and written presentation of photo-technical
information and social science field methods that employ photography as
a research tool)
<p><b>EQUITY</b> (Production of an informed interpretation of the tensions,
possibilities, and ethical concerns inherent in building equity and in
using historical, contemporary, and future cultural resources in the context
of diverse sociocultural identities and histories of struggles for power;
e.g. creation of a photographic essay and public exhibition of your work
that highlights the plight of children in a battered women's shelter)
<p><b>INFO</b> (Knowledge and skills development required to acquire, interpret,
evaluate, and use appropriate information from diverse resources; i.e.
information management and data retrieval and analysis as per SBSC Area
2; e.g. production of a photographic essay complete with a typewritten
or videotaped critical and comprehensive overview of a diverse array of
resources that speak to the subjectmatter of your photo essay)
<p><b>MEDIA</b> (Produce an informed critique of contemporary popular media;
e.g. creation of a photographic essay and or video and written text that
provides a sociocultural statement and critical commentary of stereotypes
that pertain to the interaction of law enforcement agencies in ethnic minority
communities on the Central Coast of California)
<p><b>TECH</b> (Demonstrated comfort with technology, and the ability to
use technological tools effectively, politically, creatively, and ethically
in solving problems; e.g. demonstrated development of skills in the use
of photo-technical equipment and technologically-enhanced processes (e.g.
digital enhancement) so as to produce photographic images that can serve
to document the environmental and social impacts of pesticide contamination
in California communities)
