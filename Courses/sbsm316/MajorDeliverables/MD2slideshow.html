<BR><B>Objective:</B> To test your skills at (a) preparing slides for a
public presentation or instruction, (b) presenting photographic slides
within the context of a topic or theme, and (c) oral presentations with
audiovisuals.&nbsp; Your objective will be to prepare between 8 and 12
photographic slides for an oral presentation before your colleagues.&nbsp;
The slide show should be focused on a specific topic or theme related to
the social sciences.&nbsp; Your presentation is to be no less than five
minutes, and no more than eight minutes, in duration.
<P><B>Content:&nbsp;</B> Though content will vary from one presentation
to the next, you may use slides that reflect any number of different methods
or approaches (e.g. object or studio photography or documentary or ethnographic
photography) that reflect content drawn from within the social sciences.&nbsp;
If you are not a social sciences major, you may vary your subjectmatter
so long as you make use of a theme that will cross-over from your particular
field of study (e.g. the life and work of urban or graffiti artists).
<P><B>Requirements:</B> Slides should reflect a single unifying theme (e.g.
student life, dorm life, migrant workers, homelessness, surfers, ravers,
etc.).&nbsp; The slides should constitute a theme and include (a) environmental
or site shots, (b) people or object photos, (c) detail and wide shots,
and (d) informational or event and activity shots.&nbsp; Composition, exposure,
balance, and presentation will serve as key criteria in the evaluation
of this deliverable.
<P>*See Howell &amp; Blanc (1995: 97-98; Appendix D) for some suggestions
regarding "Slide Presentations."
