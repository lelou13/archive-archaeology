<BR><B>Objective:</B> To test your skills at (a) preparing images for an
online presentation or instructional activity, (b) presenting digitized
images within the context of a topic or theme, and (c) oral presentations
with online materials.&nbsp; Your objective will be to prepare between
10 and 15 digitized images for an oral presentation before your colleagues.&nbsp;
The online slide show should be focused on a specific topic or theme related
to the social sciences.&nbsp; Your presentation is to be no less than eight
minutes, and no more than ten minutes, in duration.
<P><B>Content:&nbsp;</B> Though content will vary from one presentation
to the next, you may use online digitized images that reflect any number
of different methods or approaches (e.g. object or studio photography or
documentary or ethnographic photography) that reflect content drawn from
within the social sciences.&nbsp; If you are not a social sciences major,
you may vary your subjectmatter so long as you make use of a theme that
will cross-over from your particular field of study (e.g. the life and
work of urban or graffiti artists).
<P><B>Requirements:</B> Digitized images should reflect a single unifying
theme (e.g. student life, dorm life, migrant workers, homelessness, surfers,
ravers, etc.).&nbsp; The slides should constitute a theme and include (a)
environmental or site shots, (b) people or object photos, (c) detail and
wide shots, and (d) informational or cultural event and activity shots.&nbsp;
Composition, exposure, balance, format, and presentation of both digitized
images and online materials will serve as key criteria in the evaluation
of this deliverable.
<P>*See Howell &amp; Blanc (1995: 97-98; Appendix D) for some suggestions
regarding "Slide Presentations."
<P>*See your professor for the actual posting of the slide show within
the context of your online portfolio.
