<font color="#000000"><b>Objective: </b>To introduce students
to the primary means by which photographers and anthropologists present
their work to the public by way of public exhibition or publication.&nbsp;
The collaborative project will be undertaken during class time, as a lab
deliverable; however, if you wish to use this effort as the basis for a
final project...you may do so with approval from your instructor.&nbsp;
Three potential projects currently exist for this class, and they include
the following:</font>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000"><u>Exhibition Layout and Design Workshop</u>:</font></b><font color="#000000">
Preparation of a funded photographic exhibition by Professor Ruben Mendoza.&nbsp;
The topic centers on five years of photography at the Old Mission and community
of San Juan Bautista, California.&nbsp; Both 11" x 14" and 16" x 20" color
"R-print" images will be printed by a color lab, and black and white 11"
x 14" and 16" x 20" images will be hand-processed by Professor Mendoza.&nbsp;
The project will entail the framing, matting, mounting, and captioning
of the exhibit.&nbsp; The exhibit will consist of about twenty 11" x 14"
and 16" x 20" color prints, and approximately twenty 11" x 14" and 16"
x 20" black and white prints.&nbsp; <b>Outcomes: </b>Student learning outcomes
include training in (a) archival matting and mounting techniques, (b) assembly
of metal framing, (c) mat cutting and caption mounts, (d) object photography
and historic photo reproduction, and (f) exhibition display and design.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000"><u>Photo Essay Design and Desktop Publication
Workshop</u>:</font></b><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Entails the production
of a collaboratively developed photographic essay that will include assembling
theme-based essays and selected photographs produced in class into a photographic
publication with a broader social science theme.&nbsp; It is anticipated
and proposed that the publication in question would be printed in limited
quantities by the Offset Print program of Soledad Prison.&nbsp; Both photographs
and limited narratives would be included.&nbsp; Outcomes: Student learning
outcomes include training in (a) storyboarding a publication, (b) print
preparation for publication, and (c) edition and critique of publication
content.&nbsp; Those participants in this project who desire a tour of
the Offset Print Program at Soledad Prison can do so by arrangement with
your professor. (e.g. <a href="http://archaeology.monterey.edu/Sponsors.html">http://archaeology.monterey.edu/Sponsors.html</a>).</font></li>

<br><font color="#000000"><a href="http://archaeology.monterey.edu/Sponsors.html"></a></font>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font color="#000000"><u>Historic Photo and Flat Copy Reproduction Workshop</u>:</font></b><font color="#000000">
Students will engage the photographic and digital reproduction of historic
photographs from the community of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; The photographs
currently being copied are being developed into a San Juan Bautista Historical
Society web site located at: <a href="http://archaeology.monterey.edu/sjbhs/index.html">http://archaeology.monterey.edu/sjbhs/index.html</a>.&nbsp;
The project will entail the use of Adobe Photoshop, a flatbed scanner,
and archival materials such as cotton gloves for the handling of historic
photographs and documents.&nbsp; <b>Outcomes: </b>Student learning will
include a relative mastery of those aspects of Adobe Photoshop used in
the scanning, and enhancement of historic photographs and documents.&nbsp;
In addition, students working on this collaborative effort will be introduced
to web site development using either Netscape Composer or Dreamweaver 2/3.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000"><b>Note: </b>While the first and third projects noted
are currently ongoing efforts by the Institute of Archaeology, the Photo
Essay Design and Desktop Publication Workshop may serve as one way to publish
your final photo essay contribution for this class.&nbsp; Perhaps the most
interesting and demanding of these projects -- to be conducted during class
time -- is that of Exhibition Layout and Design.</font></blockquote>
