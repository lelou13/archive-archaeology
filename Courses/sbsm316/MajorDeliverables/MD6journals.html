<font color="#000000"><b>Objectives:</b> To provide students
with a venue in which to document the ongoing learning experience and questions
related to class content covered through the course of the semester.&nbsp;
Each class meeting of SBSM 216/316 will entail the posting of your comments
to the Online Journal located at: <a href="http://villa.monterey.edu/courses/sbsm316/journal.htm">http://villa.monterey.edu/courses/sbsm316/journal.htm</a>.&nbsp;
The posting of comments will occur during class time, and the content of
such comments will reflect your learning experience for the particular
day the comments were posted.&nbsp; Because such comments will be used
to judge your ongoing understanding of class projects, readings, and related
materials, it is critical that you post your comments as fully and clearly
as possible on an ongoing basis.</font>

the particular day on which you posted your comments.</font></li>
