<font color="#000000"><b>Objective: </b>To introduce students
to the primary means by which photographers communicate "visual narratives"
regarding the topics of the day.&nbsp; The theme-based photo essay serves
to frame the cultural scene, social contexts, and actions that frame a
particular social event or process.</font></blockquote>


<i><font color="#000000"><b>Thematic:</b> of, relating to,
or constituting a topic of discourse or a subject of artistic or cultural
expression </font></i><font color="#000000">(Webster's Third New International
Dictionary).</font></blockquote>
<b>Content:</b> The theme-based photo essay that you will prepare will
require that you invest some thought into the subjectmatter that you will
photograph during the course of an event, or through the course of a series
of days or weeks.&nbsp; The object is to provide by way of photographs
and caption information all information deemed critical to presenting the
story behind the theme or topic chosen for study.&nbsp; In much the same
way that an ethnographer, anthropologist, or archaeologist selects the
people and artifacts that represent the culture of a people, you will select
those images that you believe best represent the people or topic that you
wish to convey to the viewer.&nbsp; As such, you should include in your
imagery some or all aspects of the following:
<ul>
<li>
Location (boundaries, landmarks, geography)</li>

<li>
Appearance (visual character of locale)</li>

<li>
Organization (social and architectural arrangements)</li>

<li>
Functions (activities, services, functions)</li>

<li>
People (range of personalities and individuals)</li>

<li>
Transportation (transport, pedestrians, congestion vs isolation)</li>

<li>
Daily Cycles ( life cycle, peak vs limited activity periods)</li>

<li>
History (context, physical characteristics reflecting past use, past vs
present)</li>

<li>
Change (evidence of change, future use, construction, modification, constancy)</li>
</ul>
<b>Requirements:</b> The photo essay will consist of a minimum of ten 5"
x 7" or equivalent photographic or digitized prints mounted in a suitable
matting format.&nbsp; Mat board, or heavier bond stock, may be used for
the mount.&nbsp; The photo essay will require captions for each photo,
and a brief two page theme-based essay narrative that explains the primary
theme and provides a justification for the photos chosen for the final
photo essay.&nbsp; Individual photo captions should provide the basic information
noted below:
<p>(a) title of photograph,
<br>(b) description of content, event, or activity (as per theme),
<br>(c) location,
<br>(d) date produced,
<br>(e) type of camera and film employed in production of image, and
<br>(f) your name and copyright information.
