  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">CSUMB has been of a great learning experience.
  This is the third year I have completed and next year I will
  become a Senior. Hopefully I will be able to graduate with a
  major in Visual and Public Arts. In the long run I plan on coming
  back to school and continue my education by attempting to get
  two degrees, one in Communication Science and Technology, and
  Teledramatic Arts and Technology. I plan on making 3-Dimesional
  images, wich then I can make a cartoon off, an example of this
  is Ants, Toy Story, etc. Currently I am part of the California
  State University Residential Life as a resident advisor. I believe
  that this class has introduced me to more ways of improving my
  digital imaging skills and learning more of the basics of photography.<BR>
