The first image I choose to view was of the dancers. The colors
in the image are very vibrant and flashy. I would think that the
dance they are preforming are traditional ones and of importance
from the crowd the ceremony has drawn. The second image that appeals
to me is the building with the cow. This image was rather busy,
however, it still was very basic. I would assume that the people
who live near this location are very basic with color unlike some
of the other people I saw in photos. The last image that caught
my attention was called Allah Sees All. This picture was breath
taking. It was well composed and had great lighting. From the
title I assume they are refering to a God or belief.</FONT><FONT

Deliverable 1: Media Review<BR>

I selected fve images from Vanaity fair, December 1999 because
it was what I had around my room. Vanaity Fair is a popular magazine
aimed to women. The first photographic image I selected is a four
page ad for St.John clothing by Marie Gray. The ad was interesting
because it shows one woman walking/riding along with four or more
hispanic cowboys. The ad shows the cowboys in culturally appropriate
clothing however the woman model is in upperclass clothing. I
find the ad very unpleasing because to me it is trying to show
that this woman is better then the cowboys and thats is not politically
correct in any way. I do not think this is an accurate portrayal
of Americn society because life does not look like this anymore,
the whole seperation of class and ethnicity. The second image
I choose is an ad for Perry Ellis clothing for men. I was very
appaled by this ad because it is of a naked woman with a tree
branch covering her chest. Although it is a very well composed
ad it just goes to show how sex sells. I think this does show
that American society is still held up on sex and women whcih
makes me very uneasy. The third ad I choose was for Dolce and
Gabbana Parfums. This ad showed a woman and a man on a butcher
block going at it. This ad is not at all a accurate portrayal
of American society. A smell does not make you attack your partner
during a domestic duty in the kitchen. It is also another example
of how sex sells. The fourth image I choose was of Bruce Sprinsteen
with his guitar and other stuff in the background. I choose this
ad because it does show what role music has in our society. It
shows how one entertainer has survived fame through two generations
and still is popular. The fith ad image I choose was of a woman
at a 5 and dime like store. The caption says somthing about a
former millionar turned store owner. I think this ad represents
just what people are leaving to discover new grounds.</FONT><FONT

I worked on a slide that was of a temple or building of some kind.
Scanning the image was easy after getting the scanner to work.
I then worked on the color and contrast. I increased the yellow
tones in order to make the grass in the lower portion stand out
more.I than worked on the contrast making the image sharper as
a whole.I also croped the picture to get rid of some of the extra
dark edging.I worked a little on cleaning up the picture by editing
the visiable dust on it out.It still has a lot of dust on it and
needs some work.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#6876e7"><HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT></P>

Using those images posted on the Photo.net web site and reviewed
by your instructor, please provide a summary comment on the good,
the bad, and the ugly of photographic composition, style, and
exposure. You may also choose to comment on the varying styles
and types of photography reviewed this day...including, landscape,
portrait, candid, and documentary. I have been reviewing the pictures
on Photo.net web site under the Las Vegas link. These pictures
are of Las Vegas's scenery and night life.Several of the pictures
have interesting subjects and good leading lines.Most of the pictures
have shallow depth of focus, except for the ones of the dam.I
especially like the photos of night lights. One pictures shows
a circled licht that is moving and one that is slightly round
which I really like. The desert picture asre also very basic.
I would prefer to see more detail in the picture rather then landscape.There
is also a picture of a man gambeling which I am interested in.
Overall this link had some good pictures with good content, however
most were to plain.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#6876e7"><HR ALIGN=LEFT><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></FONT></P>

- Where lens use is concerned, what is the difference between
a standard lens, a telephoto lens, and a zoom lens? A standard
lens would be a 50 milimetter lens and would get an image as close
as what the average person would see. A telephoto lense is one
that woud inable the photographer to get an image from a far a
way distance. A zoom lenses is a lense that gives the power to
zoom in and out on an object. - What do the authors mean to say
by &quot;focal length of a lens dictates the slowest handheld
shutter speed&quot;? The length of the lense can change the view
of motion and can cause problems in hadling the weight. To prevent
this change a faster shutter speed would be better. - Why use
a tripod over hand-held use of a camera? A tripod would make the
camera more stable and prevent camera shake when using slow shutter
speeds. - What is an &quot;aperture&quot; and what is an &quot;F-stop&quot;?
An aperture is the whole in the lense that allows light to hit
the film. An F-stop is the numbering of the aperture sizes. -
How are they related? They are related in when increasing the
F-stop the aperture gets smallers and when lowering the F-stop
the aperture gets larger. - When shooting in bright sun light...which
F-stop would be preferred or required depending on other conditions:
F-1.4 or F-22? - F-22 would be better in bright sunlight because
it is smaller and would decrease the amount of light hiting the
film. - What is depth of field and how might it affect both foregrounds
and backgrounds? Depth of field is the what you see in focus behind
and infront of the focal point.It effects the forgrounds and backgrounds
because they may seem out of focus and fuzzy or on the other hand
they may seem detailed. The larger the aperture the smaller the
depth of field.</FONT></P>
