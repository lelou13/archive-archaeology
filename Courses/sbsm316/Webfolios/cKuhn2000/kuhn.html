    <P>I am a sophomore at CSUMB double majoring in Human Communications
    and Social and Behavioral Sciences. ~ I hope to continuing education
    with the high ambition of obtain my doctrine in Education which
    will allow me to pursue a career in the colleges and universities.
    ~ Growing up in the Bay Area I was exposed to a diverse community,
    which is one of the qualities, that later attracted me to CSUMB.
    ~ Our community is knew there are no traditions and no set ways,
    which allows all of us to make the way for future classes to
    come which can be a hard and frustrating task but on the other
    hand very rewarding. ~ I am currently involved in the California
    State University Employee Housing Incorporated, Residential Life
    Hiring Committee, and Residence Hall Association. ~ I was inspired
    to get involved because as a student and community member I could
    see what was not working or need to be changed in our system
    and I believed I was one more student who get involved and have
    a voice.</P>
