<p>These cows were also found along Old Coast Road...my roommate and I
took a road trip and when we took a break, these cows were there to greet
us. The photo was originally in color, but was then desaturated and cropped
in Adobe Photoshop 5.0. This may not be a great portfolio picture, but
I like it so much I decided to include it.
