<p><b>Wharf Waterfront. </b>This view is along the side of the walkway
that leads to the wharf from the parking lot. The area has a lot of large
rocks that you can sit on and enjoy the view from. To the right you would
see boats in the Marina and to the left is the Customs House. The photograph
was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using
Provia slide film, shutter speed 125, F11. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo,
May 11, 2000.
