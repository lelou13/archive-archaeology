<P><FONT FACE="Charcoal">For my Photo Essay I decided to take
a photo trip through Fisherman's Wharf. Fisherman's Wharf has
been in existence in Monterey, California since 1846. It was originally
built as a pier which gave way to the, then booming, commercial
fishing industry in the early 1900's. Today the wharf is a well
known tourist spot that attracts visitors with it's appetizing
restaurants and interesting curio shops. One can find seafood,
clothing, posters, fish and chips, awesome views, and so many
other interesting items and sites at the Wharf. <BR>
As you peruse my photographs, you will see that I have shown the
various sides that exist among the wharf. There is the tourism
industry, fishing industry, restaurant industry, educational expeditions,
and the animals and plants that live on or around the wharf. The
existence of the Wharf, however, relies heavily upon the abundance
of tourists and locals that visit the Wharf every year. Even as
a local resident who has been to the wharf multiple times, I still
enjoy visiting the Wharf time and again to see what's new, or
even just to visit a shop or restaurant that I have been to before.<BR>
Hopefully, within the composition of my photographs you will be
able to get a feeling for what the Fisherman's Wharf is all about
and how it is an interesting and colorful representation (though
it is really only a small portion of the bigger &quot;picture&quot;)
of Monterey's history. Each of the pictures were chosen for their
ability to convey an idea of the Wharf to those who haven't seen
it yet or were perhaps curious about our history and local culture.
While at the wharf try some seafood at Dockside's, have some salt
water taffy at Carousel's Candy Shop, try a lobster dinner at
Fisherman's Grotto, or perhaps have some Fish and Chips at Captain's
Gig...there are so many different things to try and many interesting
places to shop, you might find that you have to come back again!
Enjoy the beautiful sights and the get a taste for Monterey.....<BR>
