<p><b>Seafood and Snacks at Dockside's. </b>As you walk along the wharf,
not far past the entrance on the right, you'll come across a food stand
called Dockside's. There they serve fresh seafood- straight from the Monterey
Bay, drinks, and a variety of other snacks. On the ice you will always
find some sort of tantalizing kind of seafood just asking to be sampled.
The photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35
