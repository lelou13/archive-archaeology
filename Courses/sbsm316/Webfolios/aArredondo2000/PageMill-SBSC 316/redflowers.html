<p><b>Floral Scenery. </b>After passing the Customs House, you see there
are various planters with trees and flowers along the walkway. A look closer
reveals the beautiful flowers of the California Poppy and the red flower
(name unknown) shown above. The flowers above are only a small showing
of the beautiful fauna present around the Wharf and the Monterey Bay. The
photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm
camera using Provia slide film and a soft focus lens, shutter speed 125,
F6.7. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo, May 11, 2000.
