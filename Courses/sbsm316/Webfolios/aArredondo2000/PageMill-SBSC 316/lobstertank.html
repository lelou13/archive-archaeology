<p><b>Abalonetti's Crab and Lobster Tank. </b>After leaving the candy store
and continue walking along the wharf, you pass Abalonetti's Seafood Restaurant.
Outside they have this crab and lobster tank from which you can pick live
animals to be your dinner, though most of the animals didn't look too happy
to be in their captive state. The photograph was originally produced with
late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide film, shutter
speed 125, F19. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo, May 11, 2000.
