<p><b>Customs House. </b>Just after leaving the wharf you come across this
building. This is the Customs House, California's oldest government building,
which was constructed in 1827 for the collection of duties (taxes) on imported
goods . The U.S. flag was officially raised at the Customs House in 1846
by Commodore Sloat. Today the Customs House is open for tours of the interior
to help give visitors a greater understanding of Monterey's history. The
photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm
camera using Provia slide film, shutter speed 125, F6.7. Photo copyright
