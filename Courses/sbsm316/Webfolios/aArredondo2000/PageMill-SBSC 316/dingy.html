<p><b>Destination Unknown. </b>After descending the stairs, you come across
these dingys just waiting for their owners to return and take them out
for a spin. Some of the boats that are waiting at the docks have obviously
been sitting there for awhile. One may be tempted to take them out themselves,
if only to get a different view of the Wharf....The photograph was originally
produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide
film, shutter speed 250, F8. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo, May 11,
2000.
