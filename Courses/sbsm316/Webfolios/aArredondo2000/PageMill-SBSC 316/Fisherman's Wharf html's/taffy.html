<P><CENTER><B>Taffy Anyone? </B>This candy store, called Carousel
Fine Candies, is located along the left side as you continue your
walk along the wharf. Here you can find a variety of candies including,
as the sign states, salt water taffy and peanut brittle, various
other candy, ice cream, caramel apples, and more. My favorite
is the bubble gum ice cream with a caramel apple on the side...mmmm!!
The photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun
and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide film, shutter speed 60,
