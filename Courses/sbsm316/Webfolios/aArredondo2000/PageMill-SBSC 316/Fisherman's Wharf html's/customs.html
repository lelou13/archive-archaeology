<P><CENTER><B>Customs House. </B>Just after leaving the wharf
you come across this building. This is the Customs House, California's
oldest government building, which was constructed in 1827 for
the collection of duties (taxes) on imported goods . The U.S.
flag was officially raised at the Customs House in 1846 by Commodore
Sloat. Today the Customs House is open for tours of the interior
to help give visitors a greater understanding of Monterey's history.
The photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun
