<P><CENTER><B>Old Fisherman's Wharf Sign. </B>This is the sign
that is posted at the entrance to Fisherman's Wharf. In the picture
the sign is hard to read, but states &quot;Monterey's earliest
pier of stonebuilt in 1846 gave way to a commercial fishing wharf
in the early 1900's when Monterey's mullti-million dollar fishing
indusrty was born. Despite many changes the wharf today retains
the tone and flavor of the past--- monument to the fishing industry
and the fisherman who braved the wind and sea.&quot; The sign
itself helps give visitors an idea of the wharf's rich history.
The photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun
and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide film, shutter speed 125,
