<P><CENTER><B>Seafood and Snacks at Dockside's. </B>As you walk
along the wharf, not far past the entrance on the right, you'll
come across a food stand called Dockside's. There they serve fresh
seafood- straight from the Monterey Bay, drinks, and a variety
of other snacks. On the ice you will always find some sort of
tantalizing kind of seafood just asking to be sampled.  The photograph
was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera
using Provia slide film, shutter speed 125, F4. Photo copyright
