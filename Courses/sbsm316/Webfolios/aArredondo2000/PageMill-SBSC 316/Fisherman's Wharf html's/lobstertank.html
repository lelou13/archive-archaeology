<P><CENTER><B>Abalonetti's Crab and Lobster Tank. </B> After leaving
the candy store and continue walking along the wharf, you pass
Abalonetti's Seafood Restaurant. Outside they have this crab and
lobster tank from which you can pick live animals to be your dinner,
though most of the animals didn't look too happy to be in their
captive state. The photograph was originally produced with late
afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide film, shutter
speed 125, F19. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo, May 11, 2000.</CENTER></P>
