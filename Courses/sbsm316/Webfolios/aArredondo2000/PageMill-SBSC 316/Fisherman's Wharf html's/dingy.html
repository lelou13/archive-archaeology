<P><CENTER><B>Destination Unknown. </B>After descending the stairs,
you come across these dingys just waiting for their owners to
return and take them out for a spin. Some of the boats that are
waiting at the docks have obviously been sitting there for awhile.
One may be tempted to take them out themselves, if only to get
a different view of the Wharf....The photograph was originally
produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using Provia
slide film, shutter speed 250, F8. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo,
May 11, 2000.</CENTER></P>
