<P><CENTER><B>Father and Son. </B>After you pass the crab and
lobster tank, to the right you might see a father and son, or
perhaps a a crowd of children, anxiously trying to gain the attention
of the resident pigeons. In this picture the father and son are
sharing a quiet moment while feeding the birds. The photograph
was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera
using Provia slide film, shutter speed 125, F11. Photo copyright
