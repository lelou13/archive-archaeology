<P><CENTER><B>Wharf Waterfront. </B>This view is along the side
of the walkway that leads to the wharf from the parking lot. The
area has a lot of large rocks that you can sit on and enjoy the
view from. To the right you would see boats in the Marina and
to the left is the Customs House. The photograph was originally
produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using Provia
slide film, shutter speed 125, F11. Photo copyright Andrea L.
Arredondo, May 11, 2000.</CENTER></P>
