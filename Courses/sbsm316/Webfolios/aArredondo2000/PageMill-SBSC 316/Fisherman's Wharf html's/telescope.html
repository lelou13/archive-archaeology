<P><CENTER><B>In the Distance. </B>When you reach the end of the
wharf, you come to a restaurant, called Rappa's, with stairs on
each side. After taking the stairs on the right, you come to a
platform with an awesome view of the bay and the boats moored
in the harbor. As you continue walking you also encounter several
&quot;viewers&quot; or binoculars. For .25 cents you can take
a closer look at the beaches across the bay, the seals on the
jetty, the boats in the harbor, the otters swimming around, and
various other spectacular views. What do you want to look at today?
The photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun
and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide film, shutter speed 125,
