<P><CENTER><B>Floral Scenery. </B>After passing the Customs House,
you see there are various planters with trees and flowers along
the walkway. A look closer reveals the beautiful flowers of the
California Poppy and the red flower (name unknown) shown above.
The flowers above are only a small showing of the beautiful fauna
present around the Wharf and the Monterey Bay. The photograph
was originally produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera
using Provia slide film and a soft focus lens, shutter speed 125,
F6.7. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo, May 11, 2000.</CENTER></P>
