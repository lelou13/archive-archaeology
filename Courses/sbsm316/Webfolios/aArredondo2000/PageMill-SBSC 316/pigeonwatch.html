<p><b>Father and Son. </b>After you pass the crab and lobster tank, to
the right you might see a father and son, or perhaps a a crowd of children,
anxiously trying to gain the attention of the resident pigeons. In this
picture the father and son are sharing a quiet moment while feeding the
birds. The photograph was originally produced with late afternoon sun and
a 35 mm camera using Provia slide film, shutter speed 125, F11. Photo copyright
