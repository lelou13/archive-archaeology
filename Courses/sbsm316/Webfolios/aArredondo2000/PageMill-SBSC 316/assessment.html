<P>As we have finally reached the end of the semester, I have
often found myself reflecting upon the classes I have taken this
semester and what I have learned from them. As I so often do,
and this has occured every semester during my time at CSUMB, I
find myself wishing that I would have given more time to the class
and learning more than what I know now. I feel that I have learned
a lot about photograhy this semester, but there is always something
more for me to learn. </P>

<P>I have found, and this has been confimed by my professor, that
I have a knack for photographing plants, more specifically flowers.
I love flowers and I have always loved to take pictures of the
outdoors, but this semester I was able to take this pastime to
another level. This new level is called Macro Photography. I think
I enjoyed the Macro Photography portion of our class the most.
I was able to bring in flowers and plants that were found around
our lab building and be able to take such close, intimate photos
of each of them. Granted, I felt major disappointment when the
first two roles of film I took ended up coming back like they
had been exposed to the sun for way too long (in other words,
they didn't come out) but felt much relief when my second batch
of pictures came back as neat and interesting as I though they
would be. I do believe, though, that the digital representations
of my macro photography are not as pleasing and detailed as the
originals, but I feel they give the viewer an idea of what some
of these most regularly seen plants and flowers look like up close.
</P>

<P>I am also grateful for the time that we were able to spend
in the lab, actually getting hands on experience taking photographs
and using cameras (that I have not used before). I have always
been a hands-on learner and found the lab experience to be very
helpful. On the other hand, though, I do wish that we had been
able to get some experience working in a darkroom, for that is
one of the subjects I thought we would be learning about during
the semester. But, there is always another class to learn this
from.</P>

<P>While getting ready for the photographing portion of my Photo
Essay, while using a friend's camera, I was able to learn more
about cameras and how shutter speed and aperture are related to
each other. I was able to see the physical results of all the
effort and time that I put into the project. With the creating
and designing of this web page, I was able to understand web pages
and the way that photos can be presented in a web format (this
was learned after making many mistakes that had to be corrected,
therefor adding more hours to what I had already put into my project).</P>

<P>Overall, I am very happy with how I have done in this class,
besides the fact that I could have put more effort into it. I
have been finding it an interesting feat to be working full time
and trying to juggle two classes with that. In the end, though,
I think I was able to put together something very representative
of the work that I did put into the class. On a final note, I
would also like to thank Professor Mendoza for all the time that
he worked with me, reviewing slides, giving me recommendations,
and helping me decide which pictures sucked and which ones were
cool beyond belief. =) Thanks.</P>
