<p><b>Old Fisherman's Wharf Sign. </b>This is the sign that is posted at
the entrance to Fisherman's Wharf. In the picture the sign is hard to read,
but states "Monterey's earliest pier of stonebuilt in 1846 gave way to
a commercial fishing wharf in the early 1900's when Monterey's mullti-million
dollar fishing indusrty was born. Despite many changes the wharf today
retains the tone and flavor of the past--- monument to the fishing industry
and the fisherman who braved the wind and sea." The sign itself helps give
visitors an idea of the wharf's rich history. The photograph was originally
produced with late afternoon sun and a 35 mm camera using Provia slide
film, shutter speed 125, F11. Photo copyright Andrea L. Arredondo, May
