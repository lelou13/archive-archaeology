      <P><FONT SIZE="+1"> My name is Brian Laatsch and I am a student
      at California State University Monterey Bay. I am originally
      from Cupertino, California which is nestled in the western foothills
      of the southern San Francisco Bay Area. I attended Monta Vista
      High School where I played football and baseball. I enjoy many
      outdoor activities such as backpacking, mountain biking and snowboarding.
      Here at CSUMB I have continued my education and have found the
      resources of Monterey to be very helpful. The high-tech atmosphere
      on campus has allowed me to discover the advantages of using
      computers to help facilitate my projects and reports. Web page
      design and photo/slide scanning are such new discoveries that
      have greatly improved my understanding of the advantages of computer
      technology. A person can communicate with so many by creating
      a web page and using the internet to influence and inform others
      about topics that they are less knowledgeable about. My webfolio
      of images is meant to share with others the environment of Monterey
      Bay and the activities performed in my class SBSM 216/316.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
