<b>Final Portfolio:</b> All project-related materials produced
this semester, including all relevant inserts, typewritten deliverables,
lab and field forms and typewritten journal entries, should be included
in a final portfolio submitted at end of term. In addition, your final
portfolio should include an electronic copy of all lab and field notes
and related written materials. All electronic and hard copy will be used
to document project efforts in a mission-based archive. Your final Self
Assessment of this learning experience, and an overview of your respective
service learning contributions (i.e. exhibit installation, display and
or public education program), should be included within the final portfolio.
<p><b>Portfolio Format:</b> All term deliverables are to be assembled in
a portfolio binder consisting of (a) black or white 1.0" or 1.5" vinyl-covered
three-ring binder (preferably with a transparent overlay for a cover page
insert), and should include (b) a clearly formatted cover page including
course title and section number, the student's name, semester and date,
telephone number and e-mail address, and actual date at which the portfolio
was submitted (to be included as a page insert within the top cover of
the portfolio binder and in addition inserted into the first page of the
bound portfolio); (c) a table of contents listing all inserts and deliverables,
(d) all self-assessment and instructor-based assessments, term deliverables
(i.e. field and lab journal and typewritten essays and related materials),
and all completed lab and field log forms and notes, and final project-related
materials should be organized in the portfolio with transparent page protectors
or sleeves for each deliverable or assignment included in the portfolio,
(d) tabbed section dividers (color-coded or labeled), and (e) appropriate
transparent sleeves for any cassette, diskette, or video recordings or
electronic documents that you may plan to include in your portfolio. Note:
No other attachments (e.g. printed web pages used as supplementary materials)
should be included or inserted into the final portfolio submitted for end
term evaluation. In addition, all documents entered into the final portfolio
are required to include your name, course section number (i.e. SBSC 364s),
and a date of submission (e.g. 2-14-97 for February 14, 1997) placed in
the upper right hand corner of each and every page submitted. In the lower
right-hand corner of each and every page (excluding the title page), page
numbers should be clearly and accurately listed.</blockquote>
