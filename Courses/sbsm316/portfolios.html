<hr>Portfolio Format and Content Requirements</h3></center>
<b>Portfolio </b>Format: All students will be required to submit a portfolio
of those materials assembled through the course of this semester. All term
deliverables are to be assembled in a portfolio binder consisting of (a)
black or white 1.0" or 1.5" vinyl-covered three-ring binder (preferably
with a transparent overlay for a cover page insert), and should include
(b) a clearly formatted cover page including course title and section number,
the student's name, semester and date, telephone number and e-mail address,
and actual date at which the portfolio was submitted (to be included as
a page insert within the top cover of the portfolio binder and in addition
inserted into the first page of the bound portfolio); (c) a table of contents
listing all inserts and deliverables, (d) all self and instructor assessments,
term deliverables and projects inserted within transparent page sleeves
for the protection of each deliverable or assignment included in the portfolio,
(d) tabbed section dividers (color-coded or labeled), and (e) appropriate
transparent sleeves for any cassette, diskette, or video recordings or
electronic documents that you may plan to include in your portfolio. Note:
No other attachments should be included or inserted into the final portfolio
submitted for end term evaluation. In addition, all documents entered into
the final portfolio are required to include your name, course section number,
and a date of submission placed in the upper right hand corner of each
and every page submitted. In the lower right-hand corner of each and every
page (excluding the title page), page numbers should be clearly and accurately
listed.
<p><b>Final Photographic Portolio: </b>The final photographic portfolio
should represent your best efforts to capture those images that convey
the utility of documentary and investigative photography applications in
the social sciences. As such, your final portfolio should contain clearly
captioned images which specifically reflect your efforts to document a
"culture" and or cultural "theme" of California's central coast. The photographs
that you select for the final portfolio should reflect the lifeways, customs,
or attributes of an existing community, subculture, or archaeologically
and historically identifiable body of material culture and or documentation
of an event or circumstance in which photographic evidence may be used
for the purposes of reconstructing a cultural or social "scene" (e.g. crime
scene or forensic evidence). The final portfolio should consist of no less
than twelve 5"x7" or eight 8"x10" photographic prints complete with typewritten
caption information that documents the culture, scene or body of evidence
in question (i.e. in addition to the specific caption information that
serves to identify the social and cultural dimensions of the scene documented,
you should also include the name of the photographer, date that the image
was produced, the camera and lens used, technical information, type of
print (e.g. "R-print"), location, subjects, and information pertaining
to whether or not the photos in question were printed by yourself or a
custom lab). Ultimately, your portfolio should provide sufficient information
and focus so as to stand as a photographic essay of a specific culture
or cultural theme. Because digitized images submitted on-line seldom approach
the technical quality necessary for final evaluation, the final portfolio
must be submitted with photographic prints in the specified formats noted
above.
<p><b>On-Line Submissions:</b> The Virtual Learning Lab requirement permits
the submission of on-line deliverables by way of the drop folders assigned
to SBSC 395 so long as you have followed the same standards required of
all submissions (i.e. organized by way of a table of contents, caption
information, and cover statement; with all electronic documents titled
with your name, section number, date of submission, deliverable number
and subjectmatter studied). Scanned images of photographs produced as per
the assignments scheduled may be submitted via on-line drop folders so
long as these are submitted as PICT files (other formats may not download),
and it is understood that all on-line assessment is ultimately dependent
on the submission of a final photographic portfolio that adheres to the
requirements for the final portfolio noted above (i.e. 5x7" or 8x10" black
and white glossy prints and 35mm or larger format color transparencies
submitted in an 8.5x11" black or white binder with cover insert, title
page, and related materials as noted). Where typewritten documents are
concerned, these should be submitted via QuickMail or First Class e-mail,
and produced in Microsoft Word, Excell, Powerpoint, etc. for the MacIntosh.
If you are using an IBM, the primary requirement is that you both e-mail
and provide a diskette copy backup of your materials so that these can
be converted for downloading and assessment. Other programs, platforms,
and equipment for the digital manipulation of your images (i.e. scanning
and electronic editing) are available in the computing labs of the SBSC
and Media Learning Center at CSUMB.
