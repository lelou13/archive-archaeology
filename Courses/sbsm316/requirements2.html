<b>Note:</b> Due to the nature of the lab and field projects that will
be undertaken in this learning experience, it may be necessary from time
to time to wear protection (i.e. rubber, cotton, or leather gloves, helmets,
lab coats, protective goggles, respirators, etc.) and use tongs or other
appropriate tools for the handling of materials. In<b> </b>no instance<b>
</b>should you<b> </b>risk endangering<b> </b>yourself or<b> </b>other
membersof the<b> </b>team by<b> </b>engaging in<b> </b>actions that<b>
</b>create unnecessary<b> </b>risk in<b> </b>the lab<b> </b>or field<b>
</b>-- suchas those<b> </b>risks resulting<b> </b>from the<b> </b>careless
handlingof chemicals,<b> </b>equipment, and<b> </b>artifacts. Where lab<b>
</b>and field<b> </b>exercises are<b> </b>concerned, you should be<b> </b>prepared
to wear protective<b> </b>eye gear,<b> </b>rubber or<b> </b>cloth gloves,and
respirators<b> </b>where necessary<b> </b>and or<b> </b>appropriate. For
those that have difficulty with heat, cold or humidity, you should take
the necessary precautions to avoid heat exhaustion, dehydration, or other
stressors when engaged in field exercises.

Waiver or Hold Harmless form is required of all students participating
in this particular lab and field experience. While this is a formality,
it does provide us with documentation that you have been informed of the

learning experience.
