Course Deliverables</h3></center>
<b>Minimum Requirement:</b> Each student will be required to demonstrate
that they have developed the fundamental skills and obtained knowledge
of those basic technical standards required for the effective visual anthropological
and documentary use of the 35mm camera and related film mediums.
<p><b>Initial Objective:</b> To study the concepts and methods, and work
toward the development of those specialized skills, underlying visual anthropology
and documentary and or investigative photography, particularly those pertaining
to anthropologically-informed photography and studio and lab methods germane
to photo-technical imaging.
<p><b>Ultimate Objective:</b> To produce a theme-based photographic portfolio
that serves to document a culture, subculture, or cultural or social theme
of contemporary or historical relevance.
<p><b>Self-Paced Study:</b> Because this learning experience is primarily
self-paced, you may opt to complete assigned deliverables well before the
end of the term for preliminary assessment (i.e. specifically at mid-term),
or for overall assessment at end-term. The only other circumstances that
would affect self-paced or accelerated learning styles pertain to the fact
that all students are required to complete the same lab and field assignments
required of this learning experience. You may however opt to conduct the
field studies individually, and at your own convenience, so long as you
provide documentation of the field experience and its learning outcomes.
<p><b>Field Days:</b> Off campus photo excursions will be scheduled on
Saturdays at two and three week intervals through the course of the Fall
1996 semester. While it is not required that you participate in the field
excursions, such field days provide an opportunity for you to initiate
your community study under the guidance of a field mentor. Our specific
case study will entail a visual anthropological study of the community
of San Juan Bautista, where Professor Mendoza has been engaged in an archaeological,
historical, and visual anthropological field study since September of 1995.
The following tentatively scheduled Photo Field Days will be conducted
in the community of San Juan Bautista, California:
<p><b>Available Field Days:</b> 9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, September 28th,
1996
<br>9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, October 12th, 1996
<br>9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, October 26th, 1996 (TBA)
<br>9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, November 9th, 1996
<br>9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, December 7th, 1996
<p><b>Lab and Studio Days:</b> On campus lab and studio time will be made
available on Tuesday afternoons by arrangement between Professor Mendoza
and the students of SBSC 395. Lab and studio demonstrations will take place
between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m. Tuesday afternoons by arrangement. Lab and studio
days are tentatively set to take place in Building 110, which is the Service
Building fronting the front entrance (i.e. glass door entrance) of the
SBSC offices in Module 86A. Other locations will be announced as needed.
Unlike the Field Days, you are required to attend arranged lab and studio
days so that you may be introduced to the range of photographic methods
and applications available to the social scientist. Again, if you are able
to demonstrate an understanding of the methods involved in lab and studio
concepts, you are welcome to submit such documentation in lieu of attending
the arranged lab and studio times noted. The following three deliverables
represent the primary learning requirements expected of all students in
this section:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a href="../sbsc395sp96/Portfolios.html">Deliverables Portfolio.</a>
All materials produced as a result of assigned readings, journal entries,
and photographic assignments based on a cultural or social theme should
be submitted for preliminary or midterm assessment no later than November
12th, 1996 (see Portfolio Requirements for format standards). Submission
dates will vary according to your self-paced study and learning plan, however,
you should target the period between October 15th and November 12th, 1996
as a general guideline for midterm evaluation of your work. While electronic
submission is appropriate for midterm portfolios, the final photographic
portfolio should be submitted in hard copy.
<p><a href="../lab%20and%20field%20journal">Lab and Field Journal:</a>
Your Lab and Field Journal will be the second major learning requirement
of SBSC 395. Said journal should include an ongoing assessment and working
document of the subject of your specific case study research and lab and
field experience. Journal entries should include dates, locations, technical
and creative information regarding photographs produced, and socio-cultural
observations pertaining to the community under study. In addition, because
assigned readings will serve as the basis for your introduction and skills-building
in technical imaging, you are expected to provide documentation that you
have in fact completed a body of readings that pertain to your specific
area of study (i.e. said readings may be those assigned or those identified
as per your specific research effort).
<p><a href="../assigned%20readings">Assigned Readings:</a> On lab and field
days, you should come prepared to address issues, discuss concepts, and
explore methods described in readings assigned in anticipation of said
excursions or labs. While not required, you may wish to consider documenting
your readings by way of brief typewritten summaries of those readings that
lend themselves most readily to your understanding of the primary concepts
and methods of technical imaging and visual anthropology; particularly
as this may pertain to your specific field study. Because of the growing
body of internet and World Wide Web resources in photography and visual
anthropology (e.g. archaeological photography), you may opt to use web
site materials as supplementary readings. The scheduled topics will include
web site hot-links for your internet survey of currently available sites
pertaining to photographic methods in general, and social science applications
in particular. Your professor will endeavor to post relevant sites under
the topics listed in your on-line class schedule.
<p><a href="../sbsc395sp96/Portfolios.html">Final Photographic Portfolio</a>.
The final photographic portfolio will be the primary requirement of this
learning experience. Please note that all final portfolios for this learning
lab should follow the appropriate format for that specified for the photographic
portfolio, and should not include extraneous materials that have not been
specifically requested.
<p><b>Assessment:</b> Primary assessment of your learning experience will
be conducted by way of scheduled interviews and portfolio reviews scheduled
with your professor at midterm and end term. Evaluation will be based on
evidence of your attainment of basic technical proficiencies in photographic
methods judged at midterm, and this in turn will be judged in the final
analysis on the basis of the quality and content of specific images and
critical commentaries and caption information included in the final photographic
portfolio.
