<HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% SIZE=2><B>Directions:</B> The Video Storyboard
is intended to provide an entry level introduction to the development of
a "storyboard" or diagram of the narrative flow of your multimedia or video
project.&nbsp; The essential idea behind the storyboard is to identify
the different and distinct components of a multimedia project.&nbsp; Normally,
the storyboard is the first item of business to be completed in planning
the development of a multimedia CD-ROM, video, or animated story.&nbsp;
In this instance, you will review the video program entitled "This Old
Pyramid," and will build a storyboard using index cards to identify the
different and distinct learning components of the video narrative.
<P><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; Using the index cards provided, prepare
to <B>identify the primary theme</B>, and subthemes of the video "This
Old Pyramid."&nbsp; As you identify a theme or subtheme, note the theme,
subtheme, or learning exercise on the index card provided for that purpose.
<P><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; In identifying primary themes, please be
sure to note said theme or subtheme on an <B>individual index card</B>.&nbsp;
If for instance, you identify the theme as "The Scientific Method," prepare
to identify the subthemes that constitute the primary theme and its visual
narrative.&nbsp; In other words, what subthemes and examples are provided
by way of the narrative, and how do these fit into the overall narrative.
<P><B>3.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As you assess the primary components of
the visual narrative, be prepared to identify what you believe to be the
<B>principal strategies</B> (or learning modules) employed by the videographers
to illustrate those points critical to imparting an understanding of the
main themes.
<P><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; Finally, having identified the primary <B>"Themes"</B>
and <B>"Subthemes"</B> of the video narrative, be prepared to identify
and discuss those subthemes and <B>"Learning Modules"</B> that you would
deem critical to restructuring the video in question; or for creating the
makings of a multimedia project for the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.
<P><B>5.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This latter portion of the Lab Deliverable
will require a <B>written narrative</B> that you will E-mail to your professors
at the E-mail links provided in the index page of this syllabus.&nbsp;
