<br><b>Final Report, End Term Assessment, and Portfolio</b></center>
</blockquote>

<b>Objective:</b> The primary objective for the final portfolio
is that of preparing and presenting your semester's learning experience
in a singular professional format.&nbsp; By collecting and binding your
materials in an organized and logically coherent manner, you will convey
the overall quality and completeness of your semester's efforts.&nbsp;
In addition, all materials developed in this course will be prepared for
posting as an Online Portfolio, and as such, for the last three class meetings
of the semester, you will bring to class any deliverables, Online Journal
entries, and related maps, diagrams, tables, and the like in electronic
or diskette format.&nbsp; This material will be edited into html or web
documents for posting to the Internet by the end of the term.
<p><b>Format Note:</b> All materials will be assembled into a white or
black 1" thick binder with clear sleeve cover page insert for the inclusion
of the cover page&nbsp; on the face of the portfolio.&nbsp; In addition,
all written materials will be formatted in double-spaced, typewritten format
with 1.5" margins on the left-hand and top margins of each and every page,
and 1" margins on the right-hand and bottom margins of the page.&nbsp;
All documents will include your name, the course number, semester, date
and consecutive page numbers from beginning to end.&nbsp; Portfolios that
fail to meet these requirements may be deemed incomplete for the final
grade.
<p>All semester or term portfolios require the inclusion of each of the
following materials in the following order.
