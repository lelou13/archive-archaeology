<p><b>Lab Deliverable 4: Excavation Methods Review</b></center>


<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Objectives:</b> The purpose of the Excavation Methods
Review is to test your understanding of the how the "scientific method"
is deployed in the identification, layout, and excavation of archaeological
sites.&nbsp; Drawing upon your professors overview of his work at the Crescent
Rockshelter on the Colorado Front Range, prepare to describe the basic
methods, procedures, and tools used to initiate, engage, and finalize the
excavations of that ancient Native American settlement.&nbsp; Take careful
note of the terms used to identify the methods, features, units of analysis,
site characteristics, and excavation and survey units employed in such
a study.
<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to prepare your comments as a Word or simple text
document that you can either post to the Online Journal before the end
of class today, or save for later posting to the Online Journal.

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare detailed notes of your professors overview
of the archaeology methods employed in the excavation of the Crescent Rockshelter
on the Colorado Front Range located approximately 30 miles west of Denver,
Colorado.&nbsp; Said notes should include those that cover both the slide
presentation and the CNN (Cable News Network) broadcast of Dr. Mendoza's
work on the archaeological stratigraphy of the Crescent Rockshelter.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, break into at least four study and discussion
groups, and proceed to discuss the meaning and importance to archaeology
of at least ten of the following terms, tools, and concepts.&nbsp; How
do these terms, tools, and concepts relate to the overall scientific attempt
to systematize and or organize the plan of work of an archaeological dig?&nbsp;
How and why are the following terms and concepts important to assuring
"control" of the scientific method and the subsequent analysis of those
archaeological remains recovered from such sites?

<li>
Research design</li>

<li>
Research goals and questions</li>

<li>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please review the use of the aforementioned terms,
tools and concepts within the context of the writings of David Hurst Thomas
(see assigned readings and handouts for this week).&nbsp; Come prepared
to discuss those terms that you selected at the next class meeting.</blockquote>
