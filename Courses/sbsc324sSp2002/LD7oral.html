<center><b>Lab Deliverable 7: End Term Oral Report</b></center>
</blockquote>

<b>Objective:</b> The primary objective of the oral report
is to test your skills at presenting those ideas that you have explored
by way of your semester project, term paper, or field study.&nbsp; Oral
reports may be conducted in conjunction with a group, or individually.&nbsp;
In any event, your specific presentation should be no less than five minutes,
and no more than seven minutes in length.&nbsp; Presentations failing to
meet the minimum time or content requirements will be deemed incomplete.
<p><b>Format Note:</b> All presentations should begin with a brief introduction
that includes: the presenter's name, topic or title of presentation, and
a brief introductory statement that identifies the primary theme or topic
explored by way of the research, lab experiment, or field study being reported.&nbsp;
All presentations should close with a brief closing statement that serves
to explicitly state the significance of the study that you chose to undertake,
a brief summary of any findings or observations significant enough to restate,
and a brief closing comment to end your presentation.&nbsp; Upon completing
your presentation you should ask for questions and allow for about two
minutes of questions and answers only.
<p><b>Oral Report Evaluation:&nbsp;</b> Oral reports will be evaluated
on the basis of their professionalism and their adherence to basic guidelines
and protocols.&nbsp; These include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Self introduction in which presenter clearly identifies themselves for
the audience.</li>

<li>
Effective introductory statement that identifies primary theme or topic
to be presented.</li>

<li>

and definitions and explanations where needed.</li>

<li>
Evidence of scholarly efforts or research that underlies the preparation
for the presentation (e.g. bibliography).</li>

<li>
An effective closing statement that restates the significance of the study,
provides a brief summary of findings or observations, and connects study
to the overall aims of archaeology.</li>

<li>
Ability to solicit and manage questions and answers from audience.</li>

<li>
Effective and appropriate use of class handouts, visuals, web sites, multimedia,
