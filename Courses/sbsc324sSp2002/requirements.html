<center><b>Term Learning Requirements</b></center>

<p>This learning experience will encompass both <b>Lab Deliverables</b>
(LD's) and <b>Major Deliverables</b> (MD's).&nbsp; Lab Deliverables center
on those in class and hands-on projects conducted during lab and class
time.&nbsp; Major Deliverables are those that center on text-based exercises,
term projects and research reports.&nbsp; An example of the Lab Deliverable
includes "LD1: Video Review" in which you will review and comment (in writing)
on the content of an archaeology video during class time.&nbsp; An example
of a Major Deliverable includes "MD1: Self Assessment" in which you will
comment on your progress in completing assignments up to and including
the mid-point of the semester.
<p><b>Term Deliverables:</b> The total number of Lab Deliverables will
vary from term to term, and will depend on progress in meeting the goals
of the learning experience.&nbsp; This semester, we will target a total
of approximately <b>five</b> Lab Deliverables, and <b>five</b> Major Deliverables.&nbsp;
Please bear in mind that the Lab Deliverables are intended to chart your
progress in hands-on activities and participation and attendance.&nbsp;
As such, I will conduct in-class or field-based Lab Deliverables as these
become necessary to assessing your participation and attendance.
