<center><b>Major Deliverable 5: Text Exercises</b></center>
</blockquote>

<b>Objective:</b> The primary objective for the final portfolio
is that of preparing and presenting your semester's learning experience
in a singular professional format.&nbsp; By collecting and binding your
materials in an organized and logically coherent manner, you will convey
the overall quality and completeness of your semester's efforts.&nbsp;
In addition, all materials developed in this course will be prepared for
posting as an Online Portfolio, and as such, for the last three class meetings
of the semester, you will bring to class any deliverables, Online Journal
entries, and related maps, diagrams, tables, and the like in electronic
or diskette format.&nbsp; This material will be edited into html or web
documents for posting to the Internet by the end of the term.
