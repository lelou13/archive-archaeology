<b>Introduction: </b>Research Designs, Sampling Strategies,
and Site Survey.&nbsp; Or, how archaeologists go about doing what they
do and where.&nbsp; The following terms pertain to the sampling strategies
that archaeologists use to identify sites and their locations.&nbsp; These
terms are specifically relevant to Lab Deliverable 1 (Archaeological Sampling)
and are drawn from Hester, Shafer and Feder (1997).
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Research Design: </b>(a) Formulation, (b) Implementation,
(c) Data Acquisition, (d) Data Processing, (e) Data Analysis, (f) Interpretation
of Data, and (g) Dissemination of Results.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sampling Methods:</b> (a) Nonprobabilistic Sampling
(reconnaissance), (b) Probabilistic Sampling (samples collected are related
in mathematical terms to the population sampled) -- i. cluster sampling
("more than one individual in the population being sampled is taken at
each randomized position," p. 27), ii. nested sampling (sampling areas
are selected, then samples within those areas are selected), iii. simple
random sampling (total accessibility of sampled population or data universe),
iv. systematic random sampling (provides uniform coverage of an area after
first unit is selected by random procedure), v. systematic unaligned sampling
(sample population divided into large blocks, and then smaller blocks are
chose from within the larger blocks at random), vi. stratified random sampling
(a means of minimizing variability within sampling strata by stratifying
the population into classes, by for instance, environmental zones and natural
barriers)..
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- sample units (natural zones or arbitrary units
such as grid squares, quadrats, or transects)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- target population (collection of all possible
sample units or elements in the sampling universe)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- sampled population (collection of elements from
which the random sample is actually drawn)
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sampling: </b>(a) sample fraction versus sample
size (sample fraction is the percentage of the sampled population observed
or tested; whereas sample size is the number of observations actually made),
(b) sample units (size and number determined by real world considerations),
(c) surface collecting, (d) excavation sampling, (e) sampling realities.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Site Survey:</b> (a) Goals, (b) Survey Phases,
(c) Basic Considerations, (d) Factors in Survey Design (visibility, obtrusiveness,
accessibility), (e) Background Research (literature review, local informants,
history and ethnohistory, environmental variables), (f) Field Methods (pedestrian
survey, subsurface survey; comparative methods, test-pitting and effectiveness),
(g) Chemical survey, (h) Land-Based Remote Sensing (instrument anomaly
survey; passive procedures, active procedures), and (i) Remote Sensing
by Aerial Survey.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decision-Making for Sampling:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of archaeological
data is to be collected?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sampling approach best
fits the goals of the research design chosen?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If cluster sampling is used,
then the size and shape of the sampling unit must be selected.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of cluster sampling appropriate
to the project -- e.g. simple or nested -- must be chosen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sampling strategy -- either
probabilistic or nonprobabilistic -- must be chosen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If probabilistic, then the
question of how one is to control for bias must be resolved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp;&nbsp; What sampling fraction will be selected
(i.e., what percentage of the sampling universe will actually be sampled?).</blockquote>
