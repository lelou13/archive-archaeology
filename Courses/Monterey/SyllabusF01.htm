of approval by terms end.&nbsp; Of course, in order to fully address the
Culture &amp; Equity ULR, the following guidelines will need to be met
by way of your final project.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">The University Learning Requirement (ULR) on
Culture and Equity is required of all CSUMB students to graduate. To meet
this ULR, student must demonstrate a comprehension of one's individual
cultural identity in relationship to other cultures and lifestyles within
their contexts; and demonstrate critical awareness of relations of power
as well as means for creating greater equity and social justice.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">What does this mean?</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">This ULR combines the former Culture and Equity
ULRs into a single ULR. To satisfy this learning requirement, students
must demonstrate that they:</font></b>
<b><font color="#666666">1. Comprehends the concept of culture
and can apply this concept to the comparison of one’s own culture with
that of other cultures;</font></b>

(Methods), MLO 3 (Disciplinary), and MLO 4 (Applied) areas of the SBSC
Major Learning Outcomes.&nbsp; Note: If you are taking this course in order
to satisfy the second semester requirement for the SBSC core course, your
reading list will be supplemented for that purpose, and you will be required
to submit an annotated bibliography of those readings completed in this

<br><b><font color="#666666">It should be noted that the basis for grading
and assessment of this section might be subject to slight variation from
what is noted below in the event that the class shifts its emphasis for
the purposes of study options and those projects undertaken.&nbsp; Any
changes will be subject to class discussion and consensus where appropriate.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666"><u>Participation</u>: Because this course will
require your in-class participation in discussion, lab exercises (such
as that of the Map &amp; Chronology Challenge), and use of the Online Journal,
20 percentage points of your final grade will be assessed by way of your
attendance and participation.&nbsp; Participation will in part be assessed
by way of the timely and thorough completion of (a) Online Journal entries
completed on a weekly basis, and (b) the documentation of in-class Lab
Deliverables (see below) via the Online Journal and through the submission
of supporting class materials related to the Lab Deliverables.&nbsp; Because
many of these journal entries will be completed during class time, and
will address class participation and lab exercises, it is critical that
your participation be reflected in the Online Journal.&nbsp; See online
journal links at: <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Journal/Journals.html">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Journal/Journals.html</a></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666"><u>Reader Response Papers</u>: Approximately
five two-page reader response papers will be completed by you and submitted
in hardcopy as double-spaced narratives that provide sufficient detail
so that the instructor can assess your thorough completion and understanding
of the readings assigned.&nbsp; The reader response papers will account
for approximately 25 percentage points of your total grade.&nbsp; The reader
response papers will be graded at 5 percentage points each per minimum
two-page essay if they demonstrate your thorough understanding and reflection
of the readings.&nbsp; Three points will be given if a partial understanding
of the readings are reflected, and two percentage point will be offered
if the essay was completed but did not reflect a clear understanding of
the readings assigned.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666"><u>Midterm and End Term Reviews</u>:&nbsp;
A brief take-home midterm review will be assigned on the basis of questions
drawn from lecture, discussion, readings and in-class labs completed to
that point in the semester.&nbsp; In this instance, the primary reading
under review will be that of Augusta Fink’s (1972) <u>Monterey County:
The Dramatic Story of Its Past</u>.&nbsp; An End term review paper will
cover that material completed in that period extending from the Midterm
review to the end of the semester.&nbsp; The end term review in this instance
will focus on the text by Douglas Monroy (1990) titled <u>Thrown Among
Strangers: The Making of Mexican Culture in Frontier California</u>.&nbsp;
The Midterm review is worth 15 percentage points, and the final is worth
an additional 15 percentage points.&nbsp; The anticipated target length
for such essays will be five type written and double-spaced pages.&nbsp;
NOTE: The availability of the Fink (1972) text may vary, and as a result,
it may be necessary during the course of the semester to assign other readings
in lieu of the text in question.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666"><u>Final Project and Oral Narrative</u>: So
that we can address the requirements of the Culture &amp; Equity ULR, your
final project will focus on a specific ethnic or other cultural group of
the Monterey Bay.&nbsp; As your final contribution will be to work toward
the posting of a multicultural heritage website for the Central Coast,
solid research and some writing and or the development of a detailed multicultural
timeline of regional history will be required for this assignment.&nbsp;
Your option to the Internet contribution is to submit a final project paper
(of no less than 10 typewritten double-spaced pages) or you may create
and post an early “Multicultural” California website with content based
on your own research from reliable sources.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">In addition, for those that wish to draw on
early California narratives, poetry, literature, art forms, or other multicultural
forms for their final projects, the presentation formats of these final
projects may be negotiated with your professor.&nbsp; The final project
is worth 25 percentage points towards your final grade.&nbsp; Please note
that the total possible score for all projects completed stands at 100
percentage points.</font></b>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#FF0000">Challenge Project Option</font></b>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font color="#666666">While a number of local and regional histories
have been written about California and the Monterey Bay, such histories
do not tend to be “multicultural” in the strictest sense.&nbsp; By multicultural
I am referring to those histories and narratives that draw upon the broadest
representation of those contributions and voices that have come to constitute
the multicultural core of the Monterey Bay.&nbsp; For instance, back in
the summer of 1995 I collected a brochure from the Monterey Chamber of
Commerce that reviewed the “history” of the adobes.&nbsp; After a brief
note, the “history” began with a single sentence devoted to the several
thousand-year history of the American Indian on the Central Coast, and
then jumped to one additional sentence on the Spanish colonization of the
bay.&nbsp; Then, the narrative skipped past the Mexican era when most of
the adobes were constructed, and then jumped headlong into the history
of “famous” or “infamous” Americans who later lived in those same adobes.&nbsp;
I would not construe this to be a multi-culturally informed history of
Monterey or its adobes.&nbsp; On the other hand, most available local histories
tend to be devoted to some aspect of the region’s history, or focus on
a singular group.&nbsp; These too tend not to be “multicultural” in the
broadest sense.&nbsp; As such I pose the following challenges and offer
those rewards for efforts in this direction that might be appropriate.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">You are cautioned however to provide sufficient
evidence or documentation for your study so as to weigh the evidence both
for and against your position or creation.&nbsp; By taking on this project
you will be allowed the option of foregoing, or not being required to complete,
the Midterm and End term Reviews, and or the Final Project.&nbsp; Credit
for either option will depend on the extent of documentation, detail, and
accuracy of those byproducts produced.&nbsp; If you wish to forego both
the Midterm and End term reviews, or the final project, you might consider
completing more than one of the challenges noted below.&nbsp; Please note
that no Incomplete grades or assignments will be permitted in this instance.&nbsp;
In order to take on one of the following challenge options, you will need
to provide a brief proposal of that which will constitute the length and
breadth of your efforts to document a multicultural heritage.&nbsp; The
challenge options are as follows:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">1. <u>The Multicultural Timeline</u>: Creation
of a detailed “multicultural timeline” complete with dates, places, events
and or contributions made by a range of ethnic and cultural groups on the
Central Coast.&nbsp; Though the emphasis is intended to be “multicultural,”
you may choose to focus on a specific ethnic or cultural group’s contributions
so long as it represents a group for which little has been done in this
regard in the past (e.g., Filipino, Ohlone, Vietnamese, African American,
Mexican American, Irish American, etc.).&nbsp; See California in Time or
Chronology of California’s Transition (California State Parks).</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">2. <u>The Racialization Retrospective</u>:
Creation of a detailed “racialization” retrospective or chronology of events
that serves to document issues pertinent to those outcomes expected of
the Culture &amp; Equity ULR.&nbsp; The focus here should be with regard
to structures and actions that served to undermine interracial harmony,
equity, and social justice on the Monterey Bay.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666">3. <u>The Community Futures Lab</u>: Creation
of a well documented and detailed framework for how it is that you would
seek to resolve the persistent pattern of racialization, social and economic
inequities, and patterns of social injustice that tend to pervade inter-ethnic
and cultural relations on the California Central Coast.&nbsp; Please note:
You need not argue that such problems can be resolved; but rather, provide
a model for how you might go about promoting solutions given the resource
base and economic and historical realities of the day.</font></b>

California, it should be understood from the outset that class time and
travel may be required to visit and work with the collections of your choice.&nbsp;
Because there may be some students who are unable to participate directly
in the study of off-campus collections or sites, you have the option of
working primarily with the development of the online Multicultural Heritage
website and exhibit.&nbsp; For those unable to make any of the planned
off-campus field trips to local heritage sites, class and project arrangements
should be made with your professor from the outset.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666"><u>Multimedia Release and Waiver</u>: Because
some aspects of the project work will be filmed and or photographed, you
will be asked to sign a multimedia or photo release provided prior to the
beginnings of project work undertaken on campus or in off-campus settings.&nbsp;
If you choose not to be included in any filming or photography, please
indicate this fact on your signed multimedia release.&nbsp; If you choose
not to be photographed, it will be your responsibility to notify any and
all photographers, including other student photographers, of this fact
at the time that photographs are being taken.&nbsp; It will also be your
responsibility to remove yourself from areas being photographed or filmed
at any and all times through the course of the semester.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#666666"><u>Liability Release and Waiver</u>: Where
necessary, as a requirement of field and lab based efforts, you will be
required to sign a liability release and waiver.&nbsp; This assures us
that you fully understand the possible risks and or hazards that may accompany
any type of lab or field exercise.&nbsp; The Service Learning Institute
has just such a form that will be distributed prior to off-campus service
or project-related activities.</font></b>
