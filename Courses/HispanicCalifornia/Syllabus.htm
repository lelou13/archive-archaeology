  into the lives of those Hispanic and Mexican peoples and personalities that 
  undertook the pioneering exploration and colonization of early California from 
  1542 through 1848. Drawing on first hand accounts, primary resource documents,

  communities of the California central coast, (b) the earliest Hispanic entradas 
  or incursions into Alta California, (c) Spanish colonial missions and monasteries 
  of the California central coast, (d) Mexican Independence and rebellion in early 
  California, (e) Secularization and the decline of the California missions, (f) 
  Alta California in the age of the Mexican Republic, and (g) the conquest and

<p align="justify"><font color="#666666" size="2"><strong><font color="#000000">Participation:</font> 
  Because this course will require your in-class participation in discussion,

  final grade will be assessed by way of your attendance and participation. Participation 
  will in part be assessed by way of the timely and thorough completion of (a) 
  Online Journal or Discussion Forum entries completed on a weekly basis, and 
  (b) the documentation of in-class Lab Deliverables (see below) via the Discussion 
  Forum and through the submission of supporting class materials related to the

  and understanding of the readings and or discussion themes assigned. The Reader 
  Response papers will account for approximately 25 percentage points of your 
  total grade. The reader response papers will be graded at 5 percentage points 
  each per minimum two-page essay if they demonstrate your thorough understanding 
  and reflection of the readings. Three points will be given if a partial understanding 
  of the readings are reflected, and two percentage point will be offered if the

  you to bring to class the text edited by Rose Marie Beebe and Robert M. Senkewicz 
  (2001) titled Lands of Promise and Despair: Chronicles of Early California, 
  1535-1846 as this work contains many of those documents and translations to

  through weekly labs -- will necessarily require that you meet the objectives 
  of, or demonstrate proficiency in, those requirements specified for successful 
  completion of each ULR specified. The Final Project, as such, will aim to create 
  a collectively (class) designed and configured Internet site that incorporates 
  period documents, historic images, written or audio narratives, video, and related 
  multimedia that have a bearing on the theme of Hispanic California, 1542-1848. 
  Our weekly Discussion Forums will serve to review readings, and use said readings 
  as a basis for storyboarding the development of the Internet Archives Project 
  devoted to that aspect of Hispanic California specific to the California Central 
  Coast.<br>
  <br>
  Your option to the collectively developed Internet project so noted is to submit 
  a final project paper (of no less than 10 typewritten double-spaced pages) with 
  content based on your own research from reliable primary and secondary historical 
  sources. The final project is worth 25 percentage points towards your final

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<div align="justify"><br>
  <b><font color="#666666" size="2">While a number of local and regional histories 
  have been written about California and the Monterey Bay, such histories do not 
  tend to be “multicultural” in the strictest sense.&nbsp; By multicultural I 
  am referring to those histories and narratives that draw upon the broadest representation 
  of those contributions and voices that have come to constitute the multicultural 
  core of the Monterey Bay.&nbsp; For instance, back in the summer of 1995 I collected 
  a brochure from the Monterey Chamber of Commerce that reviewed the “history” 
  of the adobes.&nbsp; After a brief note, the “history” began with a single sentence 
  devoted to the several thousand-year history of the American Indian on the Central 
  Coast, and then jumped to one additional sentence on the Spanish colonization 
  of the bay.&nbsp; Then, the narrative skipped past the Mexican era when most 
  of the adobes were constructed, and then jumped headlong into the history of 
  “famous” or “infamous” Americans who later lived in those same adobes.&nbsp; 
  I would not construe this to be a multi-culturally informed history of Monterey 
  or its adobes.&nbsp; On the other hand, most available local histories tend 
  to be devoted to some aspect of the region’s history, or focus on a singular 
  group.&nbsp; These too tend not to be “multicultural” in the broadest sense.&nbsp; 
  As such I pose the following challenges and offer those rewards for efforts 
  in this direction that might be appropriate.</font></b> </div>
<p align="justify"><font size="2"><b><font color="#666666">You are cautioned however 
  to provide sufficient evidence or documentation for your study so as to weigh 
  the evidence both for and against your position or creation.&nbsp; By taking 
  on this project you will be allowed the option of foregoing, or not being required 
  to complete, the Midterm and End term Reviews, and or the Final Project.&nbsp; 
  Credit for either option will depend on the extent of documentation, detail, 
  and accuracy of those byproducts produced.&nbsp; If you wish to forego both 
  the Midterm and End term reviews, or the final project, you might consider completing 
  more than one of the challenges noted below.&nbsp; Please note that no Incomplete 
  grades or assignments will be permitted in this instance.&nbsp; In order to 
  take on one of the following challenge options, you will need to provide a brief 
  proposal of that which will constitute the length and breadth of your efforts 
  to document a multicultural heritage.&nbsp; The challenge options are as follows:</font></b> 
  </font>
<p align="justify"><font size="2"><b><font color="#666666">1. <u>The Multicultural 
  Timeline</u>: Creation of a detailed “multicultural timeline” complete with 
  dates, places, events and or contributions made by a range of ethnic and cultural 
  groups on the Central Coast.&nbsp; Though the emphasis is intended to be “multicultural,” 
  you may choose to focus on a specific ethnic or cultural group’s contributions 
  so long as it represents a group for which little has been done in this regard 
  in the past (e.g., Filipino, Ohlone, Vietnamese, African American, Mexican American, 
  Irish American, etc.).&nbsp; See California in Time or Chronology of California’s 
  Transition (California State Parks).</font></b> </font>
<p align="justify"><font size="2"><b><font color="#666666">2. <u>The Racialization 
  Retrospective</u>: Creation of a detailed “racialization” retrospective or chronology 
  of events that serves to document issues pertinent to those outcomes expected 
  of the Culture &amp; Equity ULR.&nbsp; The focus here should be with regard 
  to structures and actions that served to undermine interracial harmony, equity, 
  and social justice on the Monterey Bay.</font></b> </font>
<p align="justify"><font size="2"><b><font color="#666666">3. <u>The Community 
  Futures Lab</u>: Creation of a well documented and detailed framework for how 
  it is that you would seek to resolve the persistent pattern of racialization, 
  social and economic inequities, and patterns of social injustice that tend to 
  pervade inter-ethnic and cultural relations on the California Central Coast.&nbsp; 
  Please note: You need not argue that such problems can be resolved; but rather, 
  provide a model for how you might go about promoting solutions given the resource 
  base and economic and historical realities of the day.</font></b> </font>

  from the outset that class time and travel may be required to visit and work

  or sites, you have the option of working primarily with the development of the
