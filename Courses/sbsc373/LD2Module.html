<B>Directions:</B> The "Problem-Oriented Learning Module" provides
an opportunity to work with the "problem-based" approached to learning.&nbsp;
Generally defined, the "problem-based" approach to learning essentially
entails working from a problem or research question through to the facts
and interpretations related to the problem originally posed.&nbsp; In this
way, students and users of educational multimedia are provided a problem-based
scenario which requires interpretation and solution.&nbsp; The advantage
to the "problem-based" or "project-based" approach to learning is that
it requires direct engagement and interaction with the subjectmatter under
consideration.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas Patterson's (1994) text <U>The Theory and
Practice of Archaeology: A Workbook</U> provides a problem oriented approach
to the study of archaeology.&nbsp; In thinking through this assignment
(LD1), and that of Major Deliverable 1 (Project Prospectus), be prepared
to draw on the work of Patterson.&nbsp; Because the Patterson text provides
examples of archaeological materials and settlements amenable to particular
types of interpretation and study, you should use this text as a guideline
for framing potential questions and developing a problem-based approach
to the interpretation of the site of Old Mission San Juan Bautista.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike textbook learning, the "problem-based" approach
requires both analysis and assessment of actual or anticipated outcomes.&nbsp;
The purpose of this assignment will be to have you work toward the development
of a problem-based "learning module" for the project site under consideration.&nbsp;
Drawing on the following categories and domains of inquiry, prepare an
outline of potential "problem sets" or "exercises" that might be undertaken
at the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista:
<P><B>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Scientific Method in Archaeology and
or History (principles and procedures for the systematic pursuit of knowledge).</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognition and formulation
of a problem.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of data through
observation and experiment.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formulation and testing of
hypotheses.
<P><B>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural Interpretation (e.g. trade, social
organization, conflict)</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Deduction:</B> "deriving
a conclusion by reasoning...in which the conclusion about particulars follows
necessarily from general or universal premises" (Websters 10th, 1994:301)
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Induction: </B>"inference
of a generalized conclusion from particular instances" (Websters 10th,
1994:594)
<P><B>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural Environment.</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Influence on human settlement

<P><B>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural Geography, Setting, and History.</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demography and settlement

settlement and cultural dispersion
<P><B>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research and Methods.</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of Materials (e.g.
bone, shell, stone, etc.)

towns, etc.)
<P><B>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lab and or Field Methods.</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archaeological excavations
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field reconnaissance
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Froth flotation/sifting of
soils
