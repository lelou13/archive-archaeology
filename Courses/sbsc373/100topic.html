This learning experience represents the first part of a two part,
two semester overview of the social sciences. This portion of
the two semester introduction to the social sciences explores
primary themes drawn from anthropology and archaeology, cultural
geography and demography, and social history and related non-Western
narrative traditions. 
<P>
Subthemes explored include the interdisciplinary (or cross-disciplinary)
threads that unite the whole of the social sciences. The principal
frame of reference for this learning experience centers on how
social theory and explanations of the human condition contribute
to framing human social phenomena and processes in ways that are
researchable and interpretable, and that allow researchers to
arrive at explanatory models and assessments of human behavior
based on those observable and verifiable cultural, social, historical,
geographic, and economic and political phenomena that frame those
same dimensions taken to represent the appropriate and bounded
areas of study germane to the social sciences.
<HR>

<P>
The following themes will serve as the primary areas of study
for this learning experience. Each area will serve as the framework
around which this course is structured, and will in turn provide
the windows through which your professors will guide you through
a multitude of worlds, both past and present, that frame the human
experience. Each faculty member, in his and her turn, will provide
students with the theoretical tools and perspectives necessary
for navigating these varied areas of study and reflection.

We shall also explore how social science theories, applications,
and social facts are themselves limited by a number of fundamental
factors when applied to specific social science field conditions,
social landscapes, ethical considerations, and political realities.
Further, we shall demonstrate how social science methods, and
individual ideological and cultural orientations, serve to limit
the body of social and behavioral science theories available tosocial
scientists examining specific policies and researchable questions.
