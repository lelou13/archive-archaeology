<P><B>Primary Themes: </B>The following themes will serve as the primary
areas of study for this learning experience. Each area will serve as the
framework around which this learning experience is structured, and in turn,
will provide the window through which your professor will guide you through
a multitude of worlds, both past and present, that frame the human experience
as expressed in the social and cultural diversity and complexity that consititutes
the human community, particularly as this is reflected in the cultural evolution
of African and Eurasian civilizations. Students will be exposed to a broad
array of methods and theoretical tools and perspectives necessary for navigating
those social and cultural approaches and perspectives germane to anthropology,
archaeology, sociology, political economy, cultural history, and civilizational
analysis, and their respective applications.</P>

<P><B>Topics</B>: The comparative evolution of complex state-level society
and civilizations in Africa and Asia. <B>Case studies:</B> (a) the origins,
rise and fall of African statecraft and civilization, (b) ancient African
political and cultural systems, (c) Islamic influence and the transformation
of African civilization, (d) the art, architecture and civilizations of
the Kushite, Zimbabwe and West African Kingdoms, (e) Kushite statecraft
and African technological innovations, (f) Egyptian pharoahs and the emergence
of the dynastic tradition in the Nubia, (g) North and East African trade
and the evolution of the state, (h) Southwest Asian interaction with ancient
African civilizations, (i) the question of African influence on Greece and
the Mediterranean, (j) Comparative Perspectives in the transformation of
African culture and society, (k) European colonialism and the clash of cultures
and civilizations Africa, and (l) the emergence of the Zulu state.</P>

<P>As we approach this subjectmatter, be mindful of those procedures brought
to bear by archaeologists and related social scientists intent on exploring
and testing archaeological and cultural historical perspectives, and a host
of other social science theories, that can not otherwise be tested from
the limited &quot;synchronic&quot; (here and now) perspective of the ethnographic
moment. While ethnography can contribute to the understanding of specific
historically-determined &quot;moments&quot; in the human condition, it is
not capable of shedding light on the consequences of cultural developments
that are the product of thousands of years of human evolution. As such,
be prepared to explore the underlying cultural historical developments and
variables that set the stage for the many and diverse contributions made
by the civilizations of Africa and Eurasia; particularly as this pertains
to the worlds of statecraft and ancient science and technology. Finally,
this learning experience shall demonstrate how social science methods and
applications specific to archaeology and cultural history, its problems
and prospects, in turn serve to define and delimit the body of social and
behavioral science theories and interpretations available for examining
specific states and conditions of the human experience.</P>
