                    <br>
                    It should be noted that the basis for grading and assessment 
                    of this section might be subject to slight variation from 
                    what is noted below in the event that the class shifts its 
                    emphasis for the purposes of study options and those projects 
                    undertaken. Any changes will be subject to class discussion 
                    and consensus where appropriate.</p>
                  <p><strong>Incomplete Assessments:</strong> Please note that I do not consider <em>Incompletes</em> an option to the timely submission of any and all course materials. The only instances in which I might render an Incomplete is as the result of a medical excuse from your physician. In order for you to qualify for an Incomplete under such circumstances, I nevertheless require that you present evidence that you have successfully completed no less than 80% of your deliverables at the time of Incomplete assessment. Final Portfolios must contain all semester assignments and deliverables. In those instances where a Final Portfolio is left partially Incomplete, I will assign that grade reflected by those materials submitted in the Final Portfolio, irrespective of materials submitted earlier in the term. Finally, please note that where Incompletes have in fact been assigned, it is my policy to submit grades for completed work only during the end of term grading period after the term in which the Incomplete has been completed. Please do not seek to have an Incomplete grade changed during the course of the Summer or Winter recess as I make a policy of submitting such grades only during the end of term grading period. </p>
                  <p><strong>Formal Add/Drop Requirements:</strong> Please bear in mind that it is not the professor's responsibility to submit  Drop forms for those who decide to take leave of the class. It is your responsibility to complete the Change of Status or Drop form through the Registrar's Office. Failure to properly document a Drop will leave your professor with no option but to submit a failing grade on your behalf. </p>
                  <p><strong>Participation:</strong> Because this course will 
                      require your in-class participation in discussion, lab exercises 
                      (such as that of the Traditional Technologies Lab Challenge), 
                      and in your use of the Online Journal, 25 points of your 
                      final grade will be assessed by way of your attendance and 
                      participation. Participation will in part be assessed by 
                      way of the timely and thorough completion of (a) Online 
                      Discussion Forums or Wireless Journal entries completed on a weekly basis, 
                      and (b) the documentation of in-class Lab Deliverables (see 
                      below) via the Online Journal and through the submission 
                      of supporting class materials related to the Lab Deliverables 
                      (25 points).</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because many of the online and wireless 
                      journal entries will be completed during class time, and 
                      will address class participation and lab exercises, it is 
                      critical that your participation be reflected in the Discussion Forums
                      and or Wireless Journal. In fact, your professor uses online 
                      and wireless journal entries to assess credit for participation. 
                      See online journals at: <a HREF="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Journal/Journals.html">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Journal/Journals.html</a> 
                      and Wireless Journals at <a HREF="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/wireless/index.html">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/wireless/index.html</a></p>
                    <p>Finally, please note that much of what we cover in weekly 
                      labs will require you to bring to each class both of the 
                      required texts as each of these works contain much of the 
                      reference material that we will require for said labs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lab and Field Notes Journal:</strong> The science 
                      journal in question will require you to obtain a small science 
                      or lab notebook, available through the campus bookstore. 
                      This will be supplemented by any notes produced with the 
                      Pocket PC&#8217;s first used in the Spring 2003 version 
                      of this course. It is here that you should record your observations 
                      and findings from hands on experiments, such as those pertaining 
                      to the stone tools or garbology experiments and studies. 
                      Your notes should be detailed, carefully thought through, 
                      and coherent to the extent that someone other than yourself 
                      should be able to decipher what it is that you observed 
                      during the course of your study. You should include simple 
                      charts, tables, or diagrams of your ideas or observations 
                      as one other way of presenting your information. The Lab 
                      &amp; Field Note Journals will be submitted along with your 
                      Final Portfolios as one other measure of your participation 
                      in class labs and field studies (see Participation for credit).</p>
                    <p><strong>Reader Response Papers:</strong> Approximately 
                      five two-page reader response papers will be completed by 
                      you and submitted in hardcopy as double-spaced narratives 
                      that provide sufficient detail so that the instructor can 
                      assess your thorough completion and understanding of the 
                      readings assigned. The reader response papers will account 
                      for approximately 25 points of your total grade. The reader 
                      response papers will be graded at 5 points each per minimum 
                      two-page essay if they demonstrate your thorough understanding 
                      and reflection of the readings. Three points will be given 
                      if a partial understanding of the readings are reflected, 
                      and two points will be offered if the essay was completed 
                      but did not reflect a clear understanding of the readings 
                      assigned (25 points).</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may forego the Midterm Book 
                      Review through the submission of an additional five two-page 
                      reader response papers, for a total of ten Reader Response 
                      papers for the term. The articles that you review will be 
                      selected in consultation with your professor beforehand, 
                      or may be of your own choosing from existing class resources; 
                      however, for those articles that you select from beyond 
                      existing resources, you must obtain approval from your professor 
                      prior to preparing reviews of articles not assigned in class.</p>
                    <p><strong>Midterm Book Review or Project Proposal:</strong> 
                      A brief midterm book review will be required as one other 
                      point of departure for your instructor&#8217;s assessment 
                      of your performance at midterm. In this instance, the primary 
                      text reading for midterm consideration will be drawn from 
                      a list of at least five books provided by way of a preliminary 
                      bibliography prepared by you that will be submitted in advance 
                      for approval by your professor. In order to receive credit 
                      for the midterm book review, you will need to show that 
                      your professor approved the bibliography submitted by you 
                      prior to submission of the midterm book review itself (15 
                      points).</p>
                    <p><strong>Project Proposal:</strong> The project proposal 
                      option is required of all students who intend to see through 
                      a lab or field project. If, for instance, you determine 
                      to do a stone tools study as the basis for your final project, 
                      the project proposal should propose the focus of your study 
                      and reflect readings from the assigned Required Project 
                      Text. You should provide a three to five page summary of 
                      the goals and methods of your study and your anticipated 
                      results or findings. Archaeology majors are strongly encouraged 
                      to more fully develop the project proposal and final report 
                      as one means of walking through the process of preparing 
                      for original research, such as that that might be expected 
                      in preparing for the SBS Capstone in archaeology.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may use the midterm book review 
                      as the basis for your End Term Oral Presentation. In other 
                      words, if you read a book on modern material culture studies 
                      or &#8220;garbology,&#8221; you may use that topic and what 
                      you learned by way of your review as a basis for your oral 
                      presentation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Midterm and Endterm Self Assessments:</strong> 
                      At midterm and end term each class participant will submit 
                      a self-assessment statement in which you respond to a series 
                      of questions about your overall performance to that respective 
                      point in the semester. The questionnaire for this exercise 
                      may be found at: <a HREF="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Guidelines/Questionnaires/SelfAssessment.pdf">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Guidelines/Questionnaires/SelfAssessment.pdf</a> 
                      (10 points).</p>
                    <p><strong>Final Project and Oral Narrative:</strong> Your 
                      end term scholarly objective or requirement is to submit 
                      a final project paper (of no less than 8 typewritten double-spaced 
                      pages not including bibliography and illustrations) with 
                      content based on your own research from reliable sources 
                      drawn from at least eight separate and distinct books and 
                      or articles (see Format Guidelines at Projects). I strongly 
                      encourage the use of the Ancient Technologies and or Modern 
                      Material Culture Lab outcomes and data as the basis for 
                      developing your descriptive lab report in lieu of the standard 
                      scholarly or academic term paper project. The presentation 
                      formats for these final projects or presentations may be 
                      negotiated with your professor. The Oral Presentation in 
                      this instance should provide no more than a 5-minute overview 
                      of your learning experience specific to at those materials 
                      or concepts examined in the course of your study (see Presentations 
                      guidelines). The Final Project and Oral Presentation or 
                      equivalent is worth 25 points towards your final grade (25 
                      points).</p>
