<p><b>The Luck's Library and Museum Collection:&nbsp;</b> The Carl Martin
Luck Library and Museum is located at the corner of Third and Monterey
Streets in San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; The Library is situated at the edge
of the park named for Carl Martin Luck, and it is within the library that
the collections that will be the source of our study are currently located.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our objectives for this semester are to work with
the San Juan Bautista Historical Society so as to develop an online catalog
and exhibit or virtual museum for the Carl Martin Luck Library and Museum.&nbsp;
The collection consists of historic documents, photographs, maps, and some
artifacts related to San Juan Bautista's early history.&nbsp; The collection
consists primarily of post-Mission era 19th century Mexican and American
materials.&nbsp; In addition to a large collection of mid to late 19th
and early 20th century newspapers and photographs, the collection also
contains historic survey records of the old buildings and adobes of San
Juan Bautista.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to our work with the development of
an online catalog and web site for the San Juan Bautista Historical Society,
the materials provide a rich source for learning much more about this most
ancient community.&nbsp; As such, one outgrowth of this project effort
might center on the development of an oral history project.&nbsp; A number
of the members of the San Juan Bautista Historical Society are also the
descendants of the earliest Spanish, Mexican, and early American colonists
to the region.</blockquote>

<center>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p><b>Lab versus Field Requirements:</b> Because we will be working with
historical materials currently housed in the community of San Juan Bautista,
California, it should be understood from the outset that class time and
travel may be required to visit and work with the collection.&nbsp; Because
there may be some students who are unable to participate directly in the
study of the archival collection itself, you have the option of working
with the development of the Online exhibit and or database portion of the
project.&nbsp; For those unable to meet at San Juan Buatista, project arrangements
should be made with your professor at the outset.
<p><b>Multimedia Release and Waiver: </b>Because some aspects of the project
work will be filmed and or photographed, you will be asked to sign a multimedia
or photo release provided prior to the beginnings of project work at the
San Juan Bautista Historical Society collection at the Luck's Library and
Museum in San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; If you choose not to be included in
any filming or photography, please indicate this fact on your signed multimedia
release.&nbsp; If you choose not to be photographed, it will be your responsibility
to notify any and all photographers, including other student photographers,
of this fact at the time that photographs are being taken.&nbsp; It will
also be your responsibility to remove yourself from areas being photographed
or filmed at any and all times through the course of the semester.
<p><b>Liability Release and Waiver:</b> As a requirement of field and lab
based efforts, you will be required to sign a liability release and waiver.&nbsp;
This assures us that you fully understand the possible risks and or hazards
that may accompany any type of lab or field exercise.</blockquote>


<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#CC0000">Portfolio Format and Content
Requirements</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></blockquote>

<b>Final Portfolio:</b> All project-related materials produced
this semester, including all relevant inserts, typewritten deliverables,
lab and field forms and typewritten journal entries, should be included
in a final portfolio submitted at end of term. In addition, your final
portfolio should include an electronic copy of all lab and field notes
and related written materials. All electronic and hard copy will be used
to document project efforts in a mission-based archive. Your final Self
Assessment of this learning experience, and an overview of your respective
service learning contributions (i.e. exhibit installation, display and
or public education program), should be included within the final portfolio.
<p><b>Portfolio Format:</b> All term deliverables are to be assembled in
a portfolio binder consisting of (a) black or white 1.0" or 1.5" vinyl-covered
three-ring binder (preferably with a transparent overlay for a cover page
insert), and should include (b) a clearly formatted cover page including
course title and section number, the student's name, semester and date,
telephone number and e-mail address, and actual date at which the portfolio
was submitted (to be included as a page insert within the top cover of
the portfolio binder and in addition inserted into the first page of the
bound portfolio); (c) a table of contents listing all inserts and deliverables,
(d) all self-assessment and instructor-based assessments, term deliverables
(i.e. field and lab journal and typewritten essays and related materials),
and all completed lab and field log forms and notes, and final project-related
materials should be organized in the portfolio with transparent page protectors
or sleeves for each deliverable or assignment included in the portfolio,
(d) tabbed section dividers (color-coded or labeled), and (e) appropriate
transparent sleeves for any cassette, diskette, or video recordings or
electronic documents that you may plan to include in your portfolio. Note:
No other attachments (e.g. printed web pages used as supplementary materials)
should be included or inserted into the final portfolio submitted for end
term evaluation. In addition, all documents entered into the final portfolio
are required to include your name, course section number (i.e. SBSC 364s),
and a date of submission (e.g. 2-14-97 for February 14, 1997) placed in
the upper right hand corner of each and every page submitted. In the lower
right-hand corner of each and every page (excluding the title page), page
numbers should be clearly and accurately listed.

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#CC0000">Assessment of Deliverables</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>Because this learning experience is both service learning oriented and
project-based as per the development of a museum exhibition or online catalog
you are required to maintain a detailed semester-length journal or diary
documenting your work and participation in this course. In addition, so
as to provide a basis for reviewing your knowledge of museum methods and
class readings, course discussions will require your direct participation,
and in addition, two project and readings-related essays will be required.
As such, class readings, field and lab attendance and participation, the
timely submission of written deliverables, and finally, your respective
contribution to the collaboratively developed museum exhibition noted below
will serve as the basis for your final assessment.</blockquote>

<img SRC="silver-button-smalla.gif" height=15 width=15> <b><u>Lab
Deliverables</u>:</b> Lab deliverables are those assignments, discussion
sections, and hands-on project efforts undertaken during class time. Taken
as a whole, in-class Lab Deliverables are worth a total of
<b>25%</b> towards
the final grade. These should be submitted as handwritten notes for credit,
or posted by way of the Online Journal located at "Journals" at the top
of the Institute of Archaeology web page at: http://archaeology.monterey.edu.
<p><img SRC="silver-button-smalla.gif" height=15 width=15>&nbsp; <b><u>Text
Reviews</u>:</b> Typewritten "Text-based" Deliverables -- those assignments
based on the Burcaw (1997) or Clough (1996) texts -- are counted at <b>25%</b>
credit towards the final grade.
<p><img SRC="silver-button-smalla.gif" height=15 width=15>&nbsp; <b><u>Journal
Notes</u>:</b> All class or project meetings require note taking and preparation
on your part, and such notes -- whether handwritten or typewritten -- should
be included in your final portfolio.&nbsp; Journal notes account for <b>20%</b>
of your final grade.
<p><img SRC="silver-button-smalla.gif" height=15 width=15>&nbsp; <b><u>Final
Projects</u>:</b> Final project contributions, or Major Deliverables, be
they report and catalog based reports, or documented web site and database
development, account for the final <b>30%</b> of your total grade.
