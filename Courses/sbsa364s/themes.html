<b>Themes: </b>Primary themes center on museum conservation
methods, exhibition design and public education in local museum settings,
Hispanic and Native American arts and ethnohistory, public archaeology,
and museum anthropology studies.
<p><b>Case studies:</b> (a) the process underlying the planning, development,
and fabrication of museum education exhibitions, (b) museum renovation,
conservation, and the interpretation and display of the artifacts and project
materials recovered from the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista, (c) museum
development and renovation employing art historical, archaeological and
ethnohistorical collections and virtual simulations and related electronic
media, (d) the lab and field contexts of theory, method and practice in
the social sciences, (e) archaeology, social history, and museum education
within the context of the community under study, and the (f) the formation
and contextualization of alternative histories.

This learning experience explores primary themes drawn from anthropology
and archaeology, modern material culture studies, ethnohistory and social
history and the related study of non-Western narrative traditions. Subthemes
explored include the interdisciplinary (or cross-disciplinary) threads
that unite the whole of the social sciences (e.g. the relationship of public
archaeology and social history). The principal frame of reference for this
learning experience centers on how social theory and explanations of the
human condition contribute to framing human social phenomena and processes
in ways that are researchable and interpretable, and that allow researchers
-- particularly archaeologists and social historians -- to arrive at explanatory
models and assessments of human behavior based on those observable and
verifiable cultural, social, historical, geographic, and economic and political
phenomena that frame those same dimensions taken to represent the appropriate
and bounded areas of study germane to the social sciences; particularly
as these dimensions of human behavior are studied by archaeologists, museum
anthropologists and social historians.
<p>The following themes will serve as the primary areas of study for this
learning experience. Each area will serve as the framework around which
this field experience is structured, and in turn, will serve to provide
the window through which your professor will guide you through a multitude
of worlds, both past and present, that frame the human experience as expressed
in the social and cultural history of an early California community. Students
will be exposed to a broad array of methods and theoretical tools and perspectives
necessary for navigating those social and cultural studies germane to museum
anthropology, public archaeology, and social history.

<p>Representing History via Museum Anthropology
<p>The Writing of Alternative Histories</center>

<p>As we approach the subject of this study, be mindful of those procedures
brought to bear by social scientists intent on exploring and testing social
science theories, technical applications, research problems, and social
"facts" which are themselves limited by a number of fundamental factors
when examined in terms of specific social science field conditions, social
landscapes, ethical considerations, and political realities. Further, we
shall demonstrate how social science methods specific to archaeology, and
individual ideological and cultural orientations in turn serve to limit
the body of social and behavioral science theories and interpretations
available to social scientists examining specific policies and researchable
questions.</blockquote>
