The Alta California Mission Research Project serves as the
archaeological and ethnohistoric arm of the early California studies component
of the Institute of Archaeology. Currently, this project is engaged in
the development of a pilot study to assess the historic preservation and
museum education needs of the Old Mission and community of San Juan Bautista.
Student projects and project-based learning experiences will derive in
part from the development of a master plan for the historic preservation,
museum development, and archaeological salvage of the old mission of San
Juan Bautista. All project efforts will be geared toward the excavation,
documentation, and restoration of the archaeological and historic collections
of the mission while provisioning a museum education program operated collaboratively
by the students of the Institute of Archaeology and the mission and community
of San Juan Bautista.</blockquote>
