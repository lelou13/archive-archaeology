This project-based learning lab is devoted to the creation
of a museum education program for the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.
Student projects will center on the development of a museum exhibition,
artifact displays, and multimedia instructional materials and educational
resources directed at the bicentennial of the Old Mission. While instruction
and project development will center on those methods and procedures entailed
in the hands-on creation of a public education program for the Old Mission
of San Juan Bautista, the broader learning experience of this project lab
will address museum education and docent programming, children's multimedia,
multicultural education, cultural resource management, and information
management in public contexts.
<p>Service Learning contributions and community participation will be a
mainstay of this learning experience, and students from within the social
sciences, the arts and humanities, liberal studies, and teacher education
are encouraged to participate in this service learning practicum.
<p><b>Special information:</b> Entails both an on-campus museum education
lab practicum and museum location installation and education days. SBSA
364s is the upper division offering, whereas SBSA 264s is the lower division
offering of this learning experience. In addition, SBSA 364s is the museum
education counterpart to the field component offered via SBSC 360sl (formerly
SBSC 424sl, as offered Fall 1997).</blockquote>
