<b>Service and Project-Based Learning:</b> Because this learning
experience is both service learning oriented and project-based as per the
development of a museum exhibition and or inventory, you are required to
maintain a detailed semester-length journal or diary documenting your work
and participation in this course. In addition, so as to provide a basis
for reviewing your knowledge of museum methods and class readings, course
discussions will require your direct participation, and in addition, two
project and readings-related essays will be required. As such, class readings,
field and lab attendance and participation, the timely submission of written
deliverables, and finally, your respective contribution to the collaboratively
developed museum exhibition, inventory report, and or web site and online
database (noted below) will serve as the basis for your final assessment.
<p><b>Summary of Deliverables. </b>See the "Schedule of Deliverables" for
the specific due dates for each of the following assignments.
<p>1. Two brief typewritten research summaries (of approximately 550 to
750 words each) based on the study of at least two themes or research problems
specific to the San Juan Bautista Historical Society and Luck's Library
and Museum Project at San Juan Bautista (essays will be posted to the WWW
site of the Institute of Archaeology and or employed in the context of
exhibit information or brochures produced by the project during the course
of this semester).
<p>2. One typewritten midterm and one end-term Self Assessment -- reflective
essay -- of your learning experience at midterm <i>(see </i>Requirements
<i>and </i>Instructions
<i>for </i>Deliverables). In addition, you should
provide a draft of any project plans or materials (journal entries and
exhibit designs) completed to date. Your Self Assessments should consist
of a progress report and reflective essay of your specific project contributions,
your completion and comprehension of readings, and your progress in completing
class deliverables in a timely fashion.
<p>3. Submission of the required typewritten lab and field journal complete
with daily observations pertaining to your Service Learning experience
(should be included as an insert within your final portfolio and posted
on a weekly basis in the Online Journal located at the top of the Institute
of Archaeology web site located at http://archaeology.monterey.edu). This
should include all exhibition-related notes, diagrams, illustrations, and
lab and field logs, maps, or museum exhibit designs and exhibit-related
text produced in required portfolio format (see portfolio format in "Requirements"
section of this web site). These materials will serve as the basis for
your preparation prior to the Open House scheduled for either mid or end
term review.
<p>4. Completion of a museum education learning module and or exhibition
component for the museum of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista. Though
students will work collaboratively toward the design of one primary exhibit
area, web site, museum inventory and catalog, and or database, and the
processing of materials and information to be included therein, the actual
fabrication of display cases or exhibit materials that might be required
beyond the requirements of the course will be conducted by the volunteers
of the Gabilan Conservation Camp under the guidance of your professor;
or, provided by the San Juan Bautista Historical Society.&nbsp; All students
will participate in the joint installation of a "theme-oriented" online
museum education exhibit and or living history display, and signage, maps,
and related materials prepared by the students of SBSA 264s/364s for the
San Juan Bautista Historical Society of San Juan Bautista.
<p>5. Participation in the planning and delivery of an Open House at the
Luck's Library and Museum of San Juan Bautista. Students will participate
in the preparation of a tour brochure or booklet and program for the Open
House. Students will participate in the scheduling, preparation, and tours
for the Community Open House scheduled at mid or end term. At that time,
each student will be prepared to present and explain their respective contributions
to the Museum Education Project program of the Old Mission Museum of San
Juan Bautista.
<p>6. Be prepared to present a brief oral presentation or demonstration
(approximately 15 minutes) of the outcomes of your efforts to produce a
collaborative museum education program and or exhibition design or concept
for the Luck's Library and Museum of San Juan Bautista. You should be prepared
to outline and cite specific examples from the process required to produce
your museum education program, online exhibit or catalog, or web contribution.
The oral presentation may be presented at the Open House scheduled for
the Luck's Library and Museum of San Juan Bautista.
<p><b>Note:</b> All deliverables or assignments -- electronic and hardcopy
byproducts of this core learning experience -- should be directed at your
specific primary and secondary areas of inquiry and interest, and should
attempt to address the specific skills areas required of your particular
area of interest. If you have yet to determine what specific area of archaeology,
social history, or museum anthropology is of most interest to you, you
may choose to address more than one primary theme in your brief essays.
