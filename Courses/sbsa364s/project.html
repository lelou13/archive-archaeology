The project-based learning program of the CSUMB Institute for
Archaeology is currently engaged in the development of a conservation archaeology
and historic preservation plan at the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista.
Project-based learning experiences will center on the the ethnohistory,
and documentary archaeology of the 200 year old Spanish colonial mission
of San Juan Bautista near Hollister, California. Students will work in
collaboration with faculty participating in the Alta California Mission
Research Project, and as such, students may pursue projects drawing on
museum development and instructional technologies, historic preservation,
archaeology and the hospitality industry, documentary archaeology (text-based
and oral history), and field archaeology. The principal focus of the special
projects section will be the development of a museum education program
at San Juan Bautista coordinated between the Institute for Archaeology
and the community of San Juan Bautista. While final student projects will
center on the mediated development of educational exhibits and media, projects
may incorporate formats ranging from the design and fabrication of museum
quality educational exhibits, and or incorporate materials from typewritten
journals to multi-media, virtual reality, visual anthropology, and other
non-traditional approaches to archaeology and historiography.
<p>This learning experience entails a contract-based learning plan based
on outcomes and competencies evaluated through the development of an assessment
portfolio or related typewritten journal. As this project entails both
a lab and an off campus learning experience, students will conduct the
museum exhibits installation component at San Juan Bautista, while the
museum studies lab component will take place both in the field and at the
CSUMB Institute for Archaeology located in Building 110 on the CSUMB campus.</blockquote>
