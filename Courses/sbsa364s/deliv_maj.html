Because this learning experience is both service learning oriented
and project-based as per the development of a museum exhibition, you are
required to maintain a detailed semester-length journal or diary documenting
your work and participation in this course. In addition, so as to provide
a basis for reviewing your knowledge of museum methods and class readings,
course discussions will require your direct participation, and in addition,
two project and readings-related essays will be required. As such, class
readings, field and lab attendance and participation, the timely submission
of written deliverables, and finally, your respective contribution to the
collaboratively developed museum exhibition noted below will serve as the
basis for your final assessment.
<p><b>Summary of Major Deliverables. </b>See the "Schedule of Deliverables"
for the specific due dates for each of the following assignments.
<p>1. Two brief typewritten research summaries (of approximately 550 to
750 words each) based on the study of at least two themes or research problems
specific to the mission and museum project at San Juan Bautista (essays
will be posted to the WWW site of the Institute of Archaeology and or employed
in the context of exhibit information or brochures produced by the project
during the course of this semester). <b>Value: 10% each. 20% Total</b>.
<p>2. One typewritten midterm and one end-term Self Assessment -- reflective
essay -- of your learning experience at midterm <i>(see </i>Requirements
<i>and
</i>Instructions
<i>for </i>Deliverables). In addition, you should provide a draft of any
project plans or materials (journal entries and exhibit designs) completed
to date. Your Self Assessments should consist of a progress report and
reflective essay of your specific project contributions, your completion
and comprehension of readings, and your progress in completing class deliverables
in a timely fashion. <b>Value: 10% each. 20% Total.</b>
<p>3. Submission of the required typewritten lab and field journal complete
with daily observations pertaining to your Service Learning experience
(should be included as an insert within your final portfolio). This should
include all exhibition-related notes, diagrams, illustrations, and lab
and field logs, maps, or museum exhibit designs and exhibit-related text
produced in required portfolio format (see Portfolio Requirements, below).
These materials will serve as the basis for your preparation prior to the
Open House scheduled in April. <b>Value: 10%.</b>
<p>4. Completion of a museum education learning module and or exhibition
component for the museum of the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista. Though
students will work collaboratively toward the design of one primary exhibit
area, and the processing of materials and information to be included therein,
the actual fabrication of display cases or exhibit materials will be conducted
by the volunteers of the Gabilan Conservation Camp under the guidance of
your professor. If you would like to have more of a direct hand in the
fabrication process, please inform me of this fact so that I may provide
you a schedule of said activities. All students will participate in the
joint installation of a "theme-oriented" museum education exhibit and or
living history display, and signage, maps, and related materials prepared
by the students of SBSC 264sl/364sl for the Old Mission Museum of San Juan
Bautista. <b>Value: 20%.</b>
<p>5. Participation in the planning and delivery of an April Open House
at the Old Mission and Museum of San Juan Bautista. All students will participate
in the preparation of a tour brochure and program for the Open House. Students
will participate in the scheduling, preparation, and tours for the Community
Open House scheduled for April. At this time, each student will be prepared
to present and explain their respective contributions to the Museum Education
Project program of the Old Mission Museum of San Juan Bautista. <b>Value:
10%.</b>
<p>6. Be prepared to present a brief oral presentation or demonstration
(approximately 15 minutes) of the outcomes of your efforts to produce a
collaborative museum education program and or exhibition design or concept
for the Old Mission Museum of San Juan Bautista. You should be prepared
to outline and cite specific examples from the process required to produce
your museum education program. The oral presentation may be presented at
the Open House at Old Mission San Juan Bautista. <b>Value: 10%.</b>
<p><b>Note:</b> All deliverables or assignments -- electronic and hardcopy
byproducts of this core learning experience -- should be directed at your
specific primary and secondary areas of inquiry and interest, and should
attempt to address the specific skills areas required of your particular
area of interest. If you have yet to determine what specific area of archaeology,
social history, or museum anthropology is of most interest to you, you
may choose to address more than one primary theme in your brief essays.
