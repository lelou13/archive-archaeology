<p><b>Liability Release and Waiver</b>.&nbsp; The following linked forms
are required of students engaged in the community-based project efforts
of the Museum Education Project.&nbsp; Because of the potential hazards
that may exist in some project circumstances, students are required to
sign a Liability Release and Waiver form that serves to acknowledge that
students were forewarned of any potential hazards that might exist on a
project site.

<p><b>Multimedia Release and Waiver</b>.&nbsp; Because Professor Mendoza
documents the progress of most all project activities with film, video
and digital forms of photography, students engaged in the community project
or lab and field portions of any service activity are required to sign
a Multimedia Release and Waiver Form.&nbsp; The waiver in this instance
acknowledges that you give Professor Mendoza permission to use images or
photographs taken of you for project-related multimedia development in
video, film, and digital formats.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are uncomfortable with having your picture
taken or used in the aforementioned circumstances, you are required to
note this fact on the waiver form.&nbsp; In addition, you will be required
to inform any and all photographers, including other students who may be
taking pictures of project-related efforts, of your desire not to have
your photographs taken.&nbsp; In addition, as a courtesy to any such photographers,
you will in addition be required to remove yourself from situations which
may involve photography of students at work.&nbsp; Please ask your professor
for project alternatives when photographs are being taken during project
time.
