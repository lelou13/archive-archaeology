          research methods. Students will be introduced to the archaeology and 
          history of the early California mission communities of the Central Coast 
          by way of the Internet and hands-on study of archaeological and historical 
          materials from either Old Mission San Juan Bautista, San Carlos Borromeo 
          del R&iacute;o Carmelo, and or related early California missions. Having 
          studied the lab methods by which archaeologists examine and identify 
          the cultural importance of artifacts from a California mission, students 
          will spend approximately twelve to fourteen weeks conducting excavations 
          at either of the 200+ year old California missions in question. Final 
          projects will be posted at the Institute’s web site located at: <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu">http://archaeology.csumb.edu</a>.</font></b></p>

          of data and observations, and finally, interpretation of that data.&nbsp;
