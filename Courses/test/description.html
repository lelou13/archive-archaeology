a project-based learning lab in archaeology and archival research methods.
Students will be introduced to the archaeology and history of the early
California mission communities of the Central Coast by way of the Internet
and hands-on study of archaeological and historical materials from Old
Mission San Juan Bautista and related early missions. Having studied the
lab methods by which archaeologists examine and identify the cultural importance
of artifacts from a California mission, students will spend two weeks conducting
excavations within the 200-year old courtyard of Mission San Juan Bautista.
Final projects will be posted at the Institute’s web site located at <a href="http://archaeology.monterey.edu">http://archaeology.monterey.edu</a>.</font></b></td>

portion of your training as an archaeologist.&nbsp;&nbsp; The field school
experience serves to guide you through the process of survey, excavation,
artifact and specimens analysis, the recording of data and observations,
and finally, interpretation of that data.&nbsp; Your field experience will
prepare you to conduct basic survey and mapping, photography, and the preparation
of detailed journals regarding the results of your fieldwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lab portion of the field program will provide you direct access to
the hands-on study and interpretation of Spanish colonial, Mexican, and
early American period artifacts and specimens.</font></b></td>
