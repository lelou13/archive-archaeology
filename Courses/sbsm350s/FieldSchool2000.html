<br><b><font color="#666666">Summer 2000: Old Mission San Juan Bautista,

<p><b><font color="#CC0000">A Field School with Dr. Ruben Mendoza, Director
of the Institute of Archaeology, CSU Monterey Bay</font></b>
<p><b>Have you ever wanted to do archaeology but didn’t know where to start?
Are you an archaeology student who desires an authentic hands-on lab and
field learning experience before you graduate? Or, do you have a desire
to experience and discover California history for yourself? If your answer
is yes to any of these questions, then this field school is for you!</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Course Description</font></b>
<p><b>This course consists of a field school and a project-based learning
lab in archaeology and archival research methods. Students will be introduced
to the archaeology and history of the early California mission communities
of the Central Coast by way of the Internet and hands-on study of archaeological
and historical materials from Old Mission San Juan Bautista and related
early missions. Having studied the lab methods by which archaeologists
examine and identify the cultural importance of artifacts from a California
mission, students will spend two weeks conducting excavations within the
200-year old courtyard of Mission San Juan Bautista. Final projects will
be posted at the Institute’s web site located at <a href="http://archaeology.monterey.edu">http://archaeology.monterey.edu</a>.</b>

<p><b><font color="#CC0000">What is a Field School?</font></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;A field school is the hands-on lab and field portion of your
training as an archaeologist.&nbsp;&nbsp; The field school experience serves
to guide you through the process of survey, excavation, artifact and specimens
analysis, the recording of data and observations, and finally, interpretation
of that data.&nbsp; Your field experience will prepare you to conduct basic
survey and mapping, photography, and the preparation of detailed journals
regarding the results of your fieldwork.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lab portion of
the field program will provide you direct access to the hands-on study
and interpretation of Spanish colonial, Mexican, and early American period
artifacts and specimens.</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Where Will the Field School Take Place?</font></b>
<p><b>During the two-week portion of the project program, you will conduct
excavations in the original courtyard of 200-year old Mission San Juan
Bautista located in San Juan Bautista, California. San Juan Bautista is
located in California’s central coast area just east of Hwy 101 on Hwy
156.&nbsp;&nbsp; The site lies approximately one-half hour north of CSU
Monterey Bay.</b>
