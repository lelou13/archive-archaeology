<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Description:</B> Your final Lab Deliverable
for this course will require a brief -- five to eight minute -- oral presentation
and project overview of that study undertaken by you for the purposes of
your term project. So that we can best coordinate the presentations within
the parameters of that time available to us (see Class Schedule), you will
conduct your presentation from within the context of your normally assigned
group.</FONT>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. For the purposes of coordinating your topics
into broader "themes," please break into your pre-assigned group or team.
If you do not have a team designation, or you are in a group too small
to collaborate effectively, please join the members of the next smallest
team. If the other members of your assigned team have chosen topics widely
different than your own, you may wish to join another team.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. Having formed your team, each member of each
team should identify their respective oral presentation topic or group
theme, and each group should then decide on the order of the presentations
to be delivered by each team member during next week's final class session.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. The first or last presenter of each group will
serve as the monitor or moderator of each presentation. The moderator is
to monitor the amount of time used by each presenter, and is to signal
to the presenter when they have only one minute remaining for their respective
time limit. Because we may run short on time for presentations if time
limits are not strictly enforced, the moderator's role is critical. <I>Each
moderator will coordinate the creation of a list of topics and presenters
and submit said list by the end of today's session.</I></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. The moderator chosen for your respective group
should collect all group names and topics in that order in which said topics
will be presented. Your speaker's list should include the following: (a)
moderator's name, (b) group theme, (c) presenter's name by numbered order
of presentation, (d) presenter's topic, and (e) audiovisual needs.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Please be prepared to start your group's presentations
at the outset of the time allotted (i.e., no later than 5:10 pm). Out of
respect for your peers, it is advised that each team's members remain for
the duration of the class presentations. The ordering of the groups themselves
will be determined by lots (i.e., "a flip of the coin" or "straws").</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6. Good Luck!!!</FONT>
