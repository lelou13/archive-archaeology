<font color="#000000"><b>Description:</b> This day's learning
experience will center on the review of a video concerned with the ancient
and modern Maya.&nbsp; Entitled, "Central America: The Burden of Time,"
this video is part of a six part series entitled <u>Legacy</u> concerned
with the influence of the past on modern societies. Before airing this
video, you will be given the opportunity to review the video "Maya: The
Blood of Kings" so as to provide a comparative basis on which to evaluate
the influence and nature of media attention on the Maya.</font>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><font color="#000000">Please be prepared to address the following questions;
break into group discussion, and document some of your observations regarding
the role of the media in forming your perspectives on the Maya and other
ancient Native American groups and peoples.</font>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font color="#000000">1. Do you feel that the presentation is balanced
and or biased? If not, how would you change the video and its content so
as to address what you feel to be the real issues of concern?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">2. What does the video suggest about the link
between the ancient and modern Maya? How does the theme of "The Burden
of Time" fit into the overall presentation? How does this theme fit into
the video segment on the "Blood of Kings"?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">3. What impressions did you take from this film
regarding the ways in which the Maya have been transformed since pre-Columbian
times?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">4. How does the metaphor of the "shaman" concerned
with time and the counting of the days in a modern Maya village (ala "Burden
of Time") connect or link to the counting of the days in the ancient Maya
calendrical system? Do you feel that the "count of the days" in the ancient
Long Count system of notation have anything to do with the continued count
of the days among the Maya? If so, how so? If not, why not?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">5. Given what the video suggests about the Maya
and their respective cultural and social traditions, what do you believe
might have become of the Maya had their civilization not collapsed as it
did in the 10th Century A.D.?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">6. To what extent did the respective videos change
your preconceptions about the Maya civilization and its people?</font>
