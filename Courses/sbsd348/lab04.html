<font color="#000000"><b>Description:</b> Drawing on information
and illustrations provided in the attached handout, your group's specific
mission is to interpret the meaning of the symbolism, and known text, of
the monument or monuments to which you have been assigned. Because this
is a group exercise, each member of the group will need to actively participate
in order to receive credit for this Lab Deliverable. The steps for interpreting
the monument are provided below (please refer to your handout for additional
content):</font>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font color="#000000">1. After a brief review of the topic by your professor,
please preview the symbols included in the two handouts provided. You will
find materials drawn directly from the Schele and Freidel text A Forest
of Kings. The glossary and the individual pages of icons will prove useful
in your interpretation of the stele or Maya monuments provided on separate
pages.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">2. You have three Maya monuments to choose from
-- these are included on the separate monuments handout. As a task group,
please select the first monument to be interpreted, and working in a coordinated
fashion, select and identify individual elements on the selected monument
based on the two iconography handouts provided.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">3. Please take care to identify images and icons
pertaining to astronomy, cosmology, and Maya beliefs regarding dynastic
succession and kingship. Though not complete, especially given the large
body of icons and images related to Maya beliefs, the handouts will provide
a starting point for this exercise. Identify those icons specific to the
following:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<b><font color="#000000">&middot; Astronomy</font></b></blockquote>

<b><font color="#000000">&middot; Cosmology</font></b></blockquote>

<b><font color="#000000">&middot; Dynastic succession</font></b></blockquote>

<b><font color="#000000">&middot; Kingship</font></b></blockquote>

<b><font color="#000000">&middot; Underworld</font></b></blockquote>
<font color="#000000">4. Having identified specific elements of the constellation,
please be prepared to provide a brief written description of what you believe
the monument or monuments are attempting to convey in the way of information.
If you were to advance an interpretation of the monuments overall meaning
and significance, what would that interpretation be? Please specify.</font>
