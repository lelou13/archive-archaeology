<p><i>Traditional versus Modern Views of the Maya</i>
<hr WIDTH=

<b>Description:</b> <b>Drawing on your readings from the Sabloff
text, chapters 1 through 3, please come to class next week prepared to
respond in writing to the following questions.</b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>1. How does Sabloff characterize the nature of archaeological research
among the Maya? In other words, what did the archaeologists of the new
school of archaeology (the New Archaeologists) demand of studies and research
among the Maya? (Chapter 1)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Why does Sabloff refer to the New Archaeology as "modern scientific
archaeology"? (Chapter 1)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. Be prepared to present at least three distinct features of comparison
for how the traditional approach to the Maya differs from the new and improved
modern version of archaeology among the Maya. In other words, what are
the primary differences you see as significant between "Traditional" versus
"Modern" archaeology? (Chapter 2)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. How would you distinguish the work and interpretations of the "Victorian"
age archaeologists from those of Sir Eric Thompson's generation? (Chapter
2)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. Sabloff devotes considerable attention to the question of Maya settlement
patterns. Why are settlement pattern studies important to our understanding
of the Maya? How did the settlement studies of the 1950's through 1980's
change our views of Maya populations and agricultural practices? (Chapter
3)
