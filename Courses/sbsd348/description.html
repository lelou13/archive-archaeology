<b><font color="#FFCC33"><u>Description</u>: An exploration
of the spectacular archaeological, epigraphic, and historical discoveries
that have revolutionized emerging perspectives on the culture and civilization
of the ancient Maya of southern Mexico and Central America. Classic Maya
civilization, which has traditionally been dated to between A.D. 250 and
900, has been found to have evolved far earlier, and persisted far longer
than once thought. Epigraphic or Mayan glyphic studies and research currently
underway in the Maya heartland clearly attest to the antiquity and richness
of a culture and civilization that evolved and endured in the Mesoamerican
tropics for nearly three thousand years. Course content will draw upon
an ever expanding world of "virtual" software-based glyphic translation
and astronomical and calendrical correlation programs created for the purpose
of probing directly into the rich literary, artistic, and historical traditions
of recently recovered ancient Maya texts and monuments. This learning experience
will examine the social, cultural, economic, political, and religious underpinnings
of the Maya dynastic tradition in comparative and cross-cultural terms
and from the perspective of landmark archaeological projects and glyphic
interpretations, and their respective significance in deciphering the larger
Maya lifeway.</font></b>
