<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Introducing Mesoamerica</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Today, Mexico City is the world's largest metropolitan
center.&nbsp; From any vantage point, it is difficult to imagine that the
city lies atop millennia of ancient artifacts, constructions, and burials.
You cannot see the accumulated legacy of thousands of years of human activity,
yet this region was once the home of the Aztecs, and the many cultures
that came before them.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">When we think of the ancient people of central
Mexico, the Aztecs are usually the first to come to mind. Less well known
are the ancient cultures such as Olmec, Teotihuacan, Toltec, and Chichimec.
These names are synonymous with pre-Aztec culture in Mexico's central highlands.
Still others -- Xicalanca, Zacateca, Cholulteca, Nui&ntilde;e, Huastec,
Matlatzinca, and Chalca -- are far more obscure. Being a Mesoamerican archaeologist,
I have long speculated about these most enigmatic of Mesoamerican peoples.
Our understanding of the rise and fall of Classic civilization in central
Mexico has become keenly dependent on our understanding of them.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>The Earliest Ancestors</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">The earliest human presence in the Basin of
Mexico occurred about 12,000 years ago. The first inhabitants, bands of
hunters and gatherers, exploited the resource rich margins of the shallow
lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan, Chalco, and Xochimilco. They lived on aquatic
fowl, shellfish, rabbits, reptiles, rodents, and a variety of grasses and
other plants. Large Ice Age mammals such as the giant mammoth and mastodon
were also abundant. These prehistoric people took shelter beneath rock
overhangs and in caves.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Six thousand years ago, a warming trend signaled
the end of the Ice Age. The warmer climate, with its more abundant vegetation,
made life easier for humans. They began to establish settlements along
the southern and eastern margins of the Basin's system of shallow lakes.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">By 4,000 years ago, human populations had grown,
and the first villages were formed. Life depended upon maize, or corn,
the mainstay of the Mesoamerican diet. People lived in mud-covered, thatched
structures set atop low mounds. Village-life centered on open plazas about
which the community was oriented. During the time between planting and
harvesting, both men and women produced ceramic containers. Village women
also wove excellent cotton textiles and reed mats.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Growing numbers of ceremonies and festivals
devoted to earth and fertility, natural and supernatural phenomena, and
the leaders of society contributed to the growth of formal religious traditions.
Village shamans were thought to assume, by night, the form of a powerful
animal, such as a jaguar, a serpent, or an eagle.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Over the centuries, village life depended even
more upon a settled agricultural existence. Maize, beans, squash, agave,
chili, bottle gourds, tomatoes, and other plants became staple foods. Deities
such as the Plumed Serpent, the Terrestrial Jaguar, the Solar Eagle, and
the Old Fire God became the dominant symbols of the developing religious
tradition. Plaza-oriented ceremonial centers, platform mounds, and ball
courts became major features of the Mesoamerican landscape of 3,000 years
ago. The growth of large villages and towns in turn paved the way for the
development of chiefdoms, which often were based on hereditary ties to
mythic heroes and ancient lords.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Olmec Era</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">The Basin of Mexico was a place of many ethnic
groups and cultures. As populations expanded, so did competition for increasingly
scarce land and resources. People from distant regions, bearing merchandise
for trade, appeared in the Basin. Ultimately, trade in luxury items accelerated
social inequality within and among villages and towns. Growing trade networks
radiated from the Basin, providing access to key resources such as obsidian,
which was in great demand for cutting tools. Other desirable items included
exotics such as jade, rubber, cacao, parrot feathers, and jaguar pelts.
As trade in these luxury goods expanded, so did the military power of chieftains.</font></b>

Venta, Tabasco, circa 900 B.C.</font></font></i>

<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Not surprisingly, the centers that benefited
most directly were those that controlled the major passes leading into
and out of the Basin. Expansion of trade relations with the Mexican Gulf
Coast resulted in a major infusion of Gulf Coast cultural traits and products
into the Basin. Chalcatzingo, in the state of Morelos, due south of the
Basin, was one of the earliest centers to present evidence of a direct
link between highland cultures and the Mexican Gulf Coast. One Gulf Coast
culture, the Olmec, "people of the land of rubber," apparently influenced
the civic-ceremonial constructions, rock carvings, and ceramics of ancient
Chalcatzingo.&nbsp; By 900 B.C.,&nbsp; Olmec influence in the Mexican highlands
had a profound impact on towns and villages in the Basin. Evidence from
the more than 300 burials recovered from the town of Tlatilco suggests
that, as early as 1000 B.C., this town may well have been an Olmec colony
or outpost. These close ties clearly had a bearing on the emergence of
one of the earliest major trade and ceremonial centers in the central Mexican
highlands -- Cuicuilco.</font></b>
<b><font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>Deities such as the
Plumed Serpent, the Terrestrial Jaguar, the Solar Eagle, and the Old Fire
God became the dominant symbols of the developing religious tradition.</font></font></b></blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF9900">Cuicuilco was established some 2,500 years ago
and flourished between 500 and 200 B.C. on the fertile southern shores
of the Basin lakes. Its location, near the pass of Amecameca, played a
pivotal role in its development as a major civic center. With its massive
75-foot-high masonry mound and adjacent platform structures, Cuicuilco
was a major religious center in the Basin after 500 B.C.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">If you had lived in Cuicuilco around 300 B.C.,
you probably would have been a lakeshore resident and farmer. Much of your
life would have been devoted to tending your crops. But on market days
you would have traveled to the heart of town to barter goods and services,
much as rural Mexicans do today. You would have taken corn beans, squash,
firewood, bundled lake reeds, and obsidian blades to trade. Other merchants
or farmers would have had commodities you and others needed, such as salt,
cacao, tropical feathers, animal pelts, and many other items. Accompanied
by armed escorts, Olmec merchants, emissaries, and warriors, their faces
and bodies covered with red ochre and adorned with jaguar capes, jade amulets,
hematite pendants, and mirrors, were conspicuous on market days.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">As with the rural markets of today, important
feast days and festivals coincided with market events. Priests, warriors,
entertainers, and the social elite gathered at the temples and palaces
of Cuicuilco to negotiate new relationships, or to cement old alliances.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Cuicuilco benefited from highland commerce
until one fateful day in the third century, when its rapid expansion was
checked by an ashfall from the nearby volcano of Xitle. Only partially
abandoned, Cuicuilco quickly recovered. But a century later another sudden,
violent, and massive ashfall and lava flow smothered the city. This eruption
severed the Olmec connection to the south, and both Chalcatzingo and Cuicuilco
were abandoned. Much of the former population of Cuicuilco fled east and
north along the lakeshore into a tributary valley, now known as the Valley
of Teotihuacan. This settlement area rapidly became the center of a new
world order that would dominate highland Mesoamerica for the next ten centuries.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Teotihuacan: Life in the Metropolis</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Founded as an extensive village centered on
a series of ancient springs and caverns, Teotihuacan prospered rapidly.
By 100 B.C., the inhabitants had initiated an ambitious building program
centered on the construction of a massive civic-ceremonial precinct. This
precinct, now known as the Avenue of the Dead, became the focus of power
relations in the Basin for the next 800 years. The massive pyramids of
the Sun, Moon, and Quetzalcoatl dominated the horizon. Rising to a height
of more than 215 feet, the Pyramid of the Sun symbolized the power and
dominance of ancient Teotihuacan society.</font></b>
<p><img SRC="SunPyramid.jpg" height=192 width=288>

<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Like Cuicuilco before it, Teotihuacan was strategically
situated to exploit both resources and access to Basin commerce. As Teotihuacan
grew, the population in much of the rest of the Basin dwindled, suggesting
that state coercion was instrumental in the growth of the city.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">By the fifth century A.D., Teotihuacan boasted
a population of 150,000. Ultimately, it emerged as the premier urban center
of an international commercial empire. This first Mesoamerican empire included
towns and cities as distant as the Maya lowlands -- 800 miles away -- and
people as different from themselves and as powerful as the ancient Zapotecs
of the Oaxaca highlands.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Teotihuacan was the seat of a commercial and
political empire. Its control of highland obsidian resources near Pachuca,
Hidalgo, was clearly a major factor. After all, obsidian was the steel
of Mesoamerica. Monopolistic control of this most important resource was
tantamount to a stranglehold on commerce. Eventually, a quarter of Teotihuacan's
population was involved in the production of crafts worked from obsidian
and other materials.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Teotihuacan also boasted one of the largest
markets in the central highlands. Like Cuicuilco before it, Teotihuacan's
strategic location and control of resources served as a magnet to merchants
and emissaries from distant lands. Enclaves of Oaxacans, Gulf Coast peoples,
and perhaps Mayans grew up in the heart of the city.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Life in Teotihuacan was one of constant activity.
A day never passed without the pomp and circumstance of religion or the
panoply of royal bureaucracy lending color to the social scene. If you
had lived in one of the more than 2,000 massive apartment compounds within
the city, you would have experienced the excitement of a highly charged
social agenda, as well as the congestion, pollution, and disease that plague
any large city. Amid the smoke, dust, and odors of ceremonial and commercial
activities, foreign emissaries, merchants, and pilgrims provided a truly
international ambience.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Until A.D. 550, Teotihuacan was the most important
commercial and metropolitan center of Mesoamerica. But suddenly, at the
height of its power, the city fell victim to a massive social and political
convulsion that spread throughout Mesoamerica. Between A.D. 550 and 650,
Teotihuacan and the Teotihuacan sector of Tikal, Guatemala, had fallen
victim to a pattern of destruction that claimed gods, men, women, and children,
and cities alike. During this period, trade routes extending out of the
Basin were severed. Gradually, Teotihuacan -- and the Basin -- were encircled
by warlike peoples, most likely the Historic Olmec from the Gulf Coast.
Their objective, to conquer and eliminate their highland competitors, was
so effective that, within a century, Teotihuacan was reduced to a smoldering
ruin. People continued to inhabit the residential areas of the ruined city
for another century or so, but eventually departed for other areas of the
Basin. The towns of Texcoco and Azcapotzalco were among the many new settlements
that grew rapidly after the decline of Teotihuacan.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">After A.D. 650, dozens of major city-states
emerged in and about the Basin, each vying for political power. These centers
were related to a variety of Gulf Coast peoples. The highly militaristic
character of their art, architecture, and artifacts was clearly a sign
of the times. The towns of this era were built as fortified centers with
ramparts, moats, walls, and other related defensive features.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Age of Warlords</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">With Teotihuacan destroyed, the Basin of Mexico
was rapidly transformed into a mosaic of ethnic, cultural, and political
groups. Many new peoples established settlements in the Basin. In the adjacent
region of Puebla, Cholula fell under the domination of the Oloman tyranny.
The Oloman, or Historic Olmec, are identified with tyrannical control over
the regions of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The Oloman tyranny endured for more
than 500 years -- from roughly A.D. 650 to 1150.&nbsp; During this period,
Gulf Coast enclaves appeared at sites such as Cacaxtla and Acopinalco,
in Tlaxcala, and Xochicalco, in Morelos.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">The Oloman were civilized and sophisticated,
though highly militaristic, people related to a Gulf Coast merchant class.
Life in Oloman centers was dominated by military rituals. Political control
was based on a mix of outright coercion, alliance, and a bloody cult of
human sacrifice and decapitation fed by the acquisition of war captives.
The collapse of Teotihuacan fueled the chaos that resulted in a Mesoamerican
dark age, dominated by feudal warlords and a seemingly endless cycle of
warfare and human sacrifice.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">A second pan-Mesoamerican commercial empire
arose out of the chaos of the Late Classic and Early Postclassic period,
circa A.D. 650 to 1150. The Toltecs of Tula, Hidalgo reorganized highland
commerce, basing it on the old Teotihuacan network. From A.D. 900 to 1175,
the Toltec center of Tula, or Tollan, was at the center of a vast trade
and political system dominated by the exchange of obsidian and ceramics.
Like other highland competitors of the time, the Toltecs were highly militaristic,
and practiced cults devoted to human sacrifice and decapitation.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">If you had lived in the city of Tula, you probably
would have been a merchant, an artisan, or a soldier. Life in Tula was
dominated by the incessant pageantry of military rituals, ball games, ceremonies,
and displays of wealth and power by the merchant class. You would have
lived in a walled compound of stucco-covered masonry or mud brick dwellings
fronting an open courtyard. Within your compound, both relatives and resident
craftspeople would have spent their days producing ceramics, obsidian blades,
copper ornaments, feather work, and turquoise mosaics. The congested settlement
of Tula spread along the banks of the Rio Tula. At the margins of the city
lived the workers of the limestone and basalt quarries, and the masons
who fashioned the city's monuments. On the horizon, the hill forts of the
Toltec and related Coyotlatelco peoples stretched as far as the eye could
see.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Given the volatile nature of political relations
in the Basin at this time, commerce and military action often went hand
in hand. The many new political and military territories of the Basin made
passage between them dangerous. As in earlier periods of Basin prehistory,
life focused on the lakes, and towns and cities appeared along the lakeshores.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just beyond the pass at Amecameca, the metropolis of Cholula replaced Teotihuacan
as the commercial and religious center of the Early Postclassic period,
circa A.D. 1100. By the end of the century, conflicts between the Oloman
overlords of Cholula and the warlords of Tula erupted into another major
conflict that engulfed the Toltec center. Around A.D. 1175, a civil crisis
at Tula provoked a holocaust and led to the city's demise.&nbsp; In the
diaspora that followed, the Toltecs overran Cholula, ejecting the Oloman
overlords and setting the stage for the emergence of the Mixteca-Puebla
culture.</font></b>
<p><img SRC="Mercado.jpg" height=244 width=360>

Mendoza, 1983.</font></font></i>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">The Mixteca-Puebla culture exhibited an eclectic
style dominated by images and themes centered on death and human sacrifice.
Born of the fusion of Cholula, Oloman, Toltec, Mixteca, and other traditions,
the Mixteca-Puebla style reflected the diversity that Mesoamerica had become.
War and sacrifice became the political rhetoric of the times, and the Mixteca-Puebla
style conveyed this rhetoric in an iconography of the supernatural. Ultimately,
it was this final stage in highland prehistory that provided the basis
for the emergence of the Mexica-Aztec tradition later on, in the thirteenth
through sixteenth centuries.</font></b>
