<center><b>Lab Deliverable 5: Readings Review</b></center>
</blockquote>

<b>Instructions:</b>&nbsp; Drawing on the text by David Hurst
Thomas (<u>Archaeology: Down to Earth</u>), and one other readings resource,
you are to produce an essay summary that serves to answer the following
questions.&nbsp; Please be advised that you are required to draw directly
on the readings cited (specifically Chapters 1, 2, and 5) in David Hurst
Thomas in preparing your answers.
<p>In addition, you are to integrate into your narrative reflections on
your personal participation and observations in the lab and field exercises
undertaken this semester.&nbsp; <b>Due Date: Thursday, December 17th at
5:00pm (Office: Building 17, Room 117).</b>
<p><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does David Hurst Thomas define the scope
and objectives of the discipline of archaeology?&nbsp; Given his definition,
how do your preconceptions (preconceived notions) about archaeology and
archaeologists differ with the reality defined and discussed by Thomas?
<p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do "archaeologists walk straight lines
and dig square holes" according to David Hurst Thomas?&nbsp; How does the
approach taken by David Hurst Thomas in his excavations of the Spanish
missions of Florida differ from what you yourself have experienced by virtue
of the excavation at Old Mission San Juan Bautista?
<p><b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on David Hurst Thomas' explanation
and description of "Anthropology, Science, and the Humanities", how would
you define the "anthropological approach" to archaeology and culture?&nbsp;
In addition, please define the concept of culture in so far as your response
to the definition of the anthropological approach to archaeology.&nbsp;
In other words, what is "culture" according to David Hurst Thomas?
<p><b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, what is the scientific method,
and how is said method used by archaeologists in order to conduct lab and
field research?&nbsp; Be sure to define the scientific method, and how
said method is utilized in the field of archaeology!</blockquote>
