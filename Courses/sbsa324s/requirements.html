<CENTER><B>Term Learning Requirements</B></CENTER>

<P>This learning experience will encompass both <B>Lab Deliverables</B>
(LD's) and <B>Major Deliverables</B> (MD's).&nbsp; Lab Deliverables center
on those in class and hands-on projects conducted during lab and class
time.&nbsp; Major Deliverables are those that center on term projects and
research reports.&nbsp; An example of the Lab Deliverable includes "LD1:
Video Review" in which you will review and comment (in writing) on the
content of an archaeology video during class time.&nbsp; An example of
a Major Deliverable inlcudes "MD1: Self Assessment" in which you will comment
on your progress in completing assignments up to and including the mid-point
of the semester.
<P><B>Term Deliverables:</B> The total number of Lab Deliverables will
vary from term to term, and will depend on progress in meeting the goals
of the learning experience.&nbsp; This semester, we will target a total
of approximately <B>five</B> Lab Deliverables, and <B>four</B> Major Deliverables.&nbsp;
Please bear in mind that the Lab Deliverables are intended to chart your
progress in hands-on activities and participation and attendance.&nbsp;
As such, I will conduct in-class or field-based Lab Deliverables as these
become necessary to assessing your participation and attendance.
