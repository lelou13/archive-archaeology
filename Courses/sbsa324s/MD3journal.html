<center><b>Major Deliverable 3: Lab &amp; Field Journal</b></center>

<p><b>Introduction:&nbsp;</b> The Field Journal represents that work that
you have done to date in class and in the field portion of the excavation
or lab project.&nbsp; As such, the journal should reflect your ability
to accurately, clearly, and meticulously document what you have observed,
experienced, or studied to this point in the semester.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Online Journal entries will be used to document Lab
Deliverables (be they in the Archaeology Lab or at the excavation site)
and field days.&nbsp; As such, these should reflect an accurate consideration
of the content of that particular day(s) lab study, or field assignment.&nbsp;
Where no journal entry has been posted to the Online Journal, you should
have documentation, in the form of notes or e-mail, that provides a substitute
form for documentation and technical descriptions pertaining to that particular
lab or field deliverable.
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In using the Online Journal to search for your
entries, simply enter your full first and last name into the Name Search
on the left side of the screen.&nbsp; Once you have entered your name,
simply click on the search button, and the Online Journal should recover
all of your journal entries to date.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using an e-mail backup of the Online
Journal, simply cut and paste the content of your e-mail messages into
a Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect document and save the new document
in the following form:&nbsp; [course number, last name, semester, and Major
Deliverable number].&nbsp; Professor Mendoza's journal would follow the
following format in terms of file name:&nbsp; <b>sbsa324sMendozaF99MD1</b>].
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the Online Journal, or your related document
or e-mail files of the same, prepare a print version of all of your Online
Journal entries to date and submit to Professor Mendoza by the next class
meeting.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Mendoza will assess the content of your
Online Journal entries in terms of readability, content, clarity, critical
thinking and reflection, engagement with the subject-matter, lab and field
participation, and the appropriate use of key terms and concepts from the
field of archaeology.
