<center><b>Lab Deliverable 3: Material Cultures Assessment</b></center>

<b>Instructions:</b>&nbsp; Drawing on those items provided
by your professor, you will undertake two distinct tasks.&nbsp; The first
task will entail interpreting images or items of material culture from
an item of "foreign" manufacture.&nbsp; In this instance, you will undertake
to provide a "technical description" of the body of material culture represented.&nbsp;
In the second instance, you will each be provided with some item of material
culture, and you will take on the challenge of describing said item in
a second clearly crafted and concise "technical description."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By technical description, I am referring to a description
that provides a clear, concise, and technically accurate and precise description
of some artifact or process.&nbsp; For example, if you were to describe
the computer on your desktop, you would provide a description of the size,
shape, color, composition, function, and origins of the item of material
culture in question.
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this first instance, you will break into groups
and examine the facsimile copy of the ancient Mexican screen-fold "codex"
brought to lab by your professor.&nbsp; In examing the "codex" in question,
you are to interpret the following:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, identify and describe
the primary function and overall format of the codex in question.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, provide an interpretation
of how you believe the manuscript in question was interpreted and "read."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, identify the primary
theme of that section of the manuscript that you and your group have chosen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select at least a half dozen
items of material culture and describe them as a group of "related" items.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second exercise in this lab entails creating
a technical description for the artifacts provided by your professor.&nbsp;
You are to provide a technical description that includes the "Who, What,
Where, When, Why, and How" of the item in question.&nbsp; In this instance,
you should interpret this to mean the "size, shape, color, composition,
function, and origins" of the artifact in question.&nbsp; Use that terminology
that you believe to be appropriate in this instance.</blockquote>
