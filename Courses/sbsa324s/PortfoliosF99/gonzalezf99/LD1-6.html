<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first ten selections I made, were
because I was looking at the key for the map and I was mainly looking for
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; populated areas.(U6, U4, U3, U2, T2,
T3, A8, A9, N10, and K9) The transects that I chose were for mostly the
same
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reason of getting some rows that showed
some population. (2, K, 9, 6, and I) The third ten selections were made
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of where I thought that there
was people living because of the place that they were in, such as that
of them living
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nearby a river or a place where they
could easily walk over to get water. (F7, K2, F6, A8, M7, L2, U2, N10,
R2, and V1)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These last five selections I just chose
because of the location in the map and because it looks interesting to
explore. (M3,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B8, J7, L3, and P12)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The primary "myth" of achaelogy and
the moundbuilders were that they could not have been made by the American
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indians and that somehow any other race
could have constructed the mounds except the Indians. The other myth was
that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since they would find particles of the
same nature and or the same material, in several sites, there was reason
to believe
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that these mounds were constructed by
the same race. I believe that this was untrue just because of the newest
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discoveries and the different information
that we now have. 2. I feel that the mound reconstruction was very valued
by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these achaelogists for the very reason
that they wanted to find out many things on how it was that the moundbuilders
went
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about doing the construction of the
mounds, how long did it take them, and how many people it took. The experiment
is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; important because of the different things
that were placed in the thomb and also for future reference.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This movie was of much interest to me
since I did not know that there is a way to make a chemical that is better
than
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cement such as that of the juice of
the nopal and some dirt or sand. It is also interesting to find out how
much effort and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time it takes to restore the Church.
I feel that the artists do a great work and share their beliefs in that
of which this is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their art work so they cannot get too
much into them. You also have to realize that this is art and you cannot
restore it so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that means that you have to do the least
possible to keep it genuine if it is not damaged. It is also interesting
to know that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this particular Church was built in
the form of a cross a (Latin Cross)This to me shows how much devotion existed,
back
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the days, towards God and the Christian-Catholic
religion. This again explains all of the murals, images, and sculptures
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the devotion to God. There was particularly
a lot of images and murals of the Virgen Mary. It was found that they had
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more images of the Virgen than any other
Saints. This mission reminds me of Mexico where every little town and every
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big city has a particular Saint as their
Patron.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From what was found I can guess that
this was a site for trading. I feel that this was also a place where they
would hold
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very prestigious events in which they
would have trades, and maybe also a place where they would kill their meals
with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tools they would make out of stone.
I believe that there was a lot of cattle that they would take care off
for different
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purposes.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. This character is portrayed as a
warrior with a tree on his head. It also seems that he has a stripe down
his face just
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like other characters. He also is wearing
earrings that depict what age, wealth, and or stage he is at. The tree
goes up
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; towards heaven. 2. These two characters
are facing each other and they appear to be wearing headdressing which
lets
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me know that they were both war lords
and or kings. They also appear to be getting ready for battle and they
are also
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing earrings. 3. This character
seems to represent the Plum Serpent. I say that because I see the serpent
with a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head of a person but there is no body
present.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The munsell of the artifact is 5YR 4/
4. The approximate size of the artifact is 2.5" in length, .75" in width,
and .5" in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thickness. There are various ridges.
There is also various flake scars. I believe that the distal part of my
artifact is the one
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the most detail, which includes
most of the flake and ridges. I believe that the proximal side would be
the one with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less detail. It also seems to me that
this is a similar artifact to that of a clovis artifact, but a lot skinnier
and longer that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; normal. This looks like it would be
a artifact that could be used as a weapon, such as a lance, or an arrow.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was looking at the CNN report,
it was of great interest to see what it was that the News was out to cover.
The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slides helped me out, in the understanding
of what the area looked like and what it was that they were searching for.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the slides gave me an idea
of how it was that the search crew formed their plan for the research.
The research
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; methology in the way that they have
to be precise when it comes to finding and artifact, the amount of effort
that is put in to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; logging everything that you do is just
amazing. The way that they go level by level of two inches makes it seem
very
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organized. I feel that all of the planning
about this site work was planned very well. When it comes to research goals
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; questions, I tend to think of when Professor
Mendoza says that there had been archaeologists that said there was no
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible way that there could have been
any kind of human remains or activities in that particular area. I also
feel that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goal for this, was that the crew wanted
to prove and find any kind of evidence that proved that there had been
human
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remains and or activity. I think that
the process of the soil analysis was particularly a method that is of interest
to me
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of the color change in the soil
and what the meaning of the different combinations for soil may be. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conbination of dark and light soil in
a specific level can mean that the site was disturbed at that time, and
therefore you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can have proof that there was some kind
of human activity. Site topography was the way that they were able to find
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different locations where the people
that once lived there could have lived or taken many of their hunting practices.
I feel
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the excavation methods were methods
that take place slowly and carefully just because of the different things
that you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can find and how the artifacts can be
very fragile and valuable.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search for the "Lost Spanish
Mission" the team led by David Hurst Thomas the tools used were the transect
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sampling strategy in which they walked
east and west transects which measured 100 meters wide, they then searched
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every site with two or more one meter
square test units totaling in up to 400 pits. They then used a posthole
digger
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine that was gasoline powered and
excavated hundreds of holes. With this machine they were able to dig a
3 foot
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deep hole in less than a minute. They
also used a power auger which throws up a sample of dirt to be hand sifted
for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifacts. A proton precession magnetometer
was also used to measure the strength of of magnetism between the earth's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; magnetic core and a sensor controlled
by the archaeologist. Personally I think that there was many advantages
to using
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of these tools. For example I feel
that there was a lot of time that was saved and the information was probably
a lot
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more concise or exact do to the technology
that was used. They also used machines that would preserve the land and
let
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them know ahead of time if it was a
good idea to keep digging or to stop. I feel that the methods were applied
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully just because of the time
management and the preserving of the land. 2. According to Thomas they
do this to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceptualize their research area. The
rationalization of being able to conceptualize the research area are why
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archaeologists dig square holes. This
also gives them an idea as to how the objects are related to each other
do to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place that they were found. 3. Ethnoarchaeology,
Garbology, and Experimental Archaeology are what make up the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concept of Middle Range Research. Ethnoarchaeology
is the study in which the archaeologist goes to a place and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; studies the culture by living in the
site and by making assumptions of the way the people that lived once lived
there.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garbology is the study in which the
archaeologist studies the trash of the individual(s) and determines their
style of life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based upon the type of garbage that
is found. For example the type of clothing can be determined by the pieces
of cloth
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that one may find in the trash, or the
type of food the individual(s) like based upon the remains of food that
are found.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimental Archaeology is when the
archaeologist try to do things in such way that they believe that was the
way it was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done in the past based on evidence that
is found. For example they will do flinknapping in the way that they think
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people of the past would do it procedure
wise. from the past might have done them.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that the flinknapping that was
done in the lab on Thursday was of much interest to me, since I believe
that one of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main ways to learn is by hands on experience.
I feel that the knowledge of knowing what type of tools should be used
in a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; related way to whatever it is that you
want to create. For example if you want to make a small arrow head you
might want
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to start with a fairly workable size
of obsidian so that you can work your way down and use a big stone tool
to flake away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you get to a smaller obsidian then
you might want to change to an antler point which is made up of compressed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hair. I also feel that wearing all of
the protective gear is a must because these flakes are very sharp and are
capable of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opening a pretty deep wound.
