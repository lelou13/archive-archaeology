<p>Author: Pedro Gonzalez.- Subject: Garbology 1

Entry Num: 148
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garbology is an interesting subject
for me. After watching the CNN video, I found it interesting to look at
garbage as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; answers to what it is that causes people
to gain weight and or what their diet looks like. The other interesting
part of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; video was the research done by the student
that get permission from the pastor, and finds that the pastor has a pretty
bad
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diet along with his family. It is interesting
to find that the Pastor finds himself lying about what it is that his family's
eating
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; habits are. I feel that the video and
this class played a major keypoint for those that want to do the garbology
project. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other researches that were presented
in class were also important because of what the subject was, and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involvements of what it was that a person
had to go through in order to finish the project such as bad neighborhoods,
or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing research on people with a bad
temper or criminal background. That is why I believe that the research,
at least this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time, should be done on a person that
one is particularly familiar with. Your trash can say a lot for you and
it can also give
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you the answers to why it is that you
feel the way you do.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that if I were in charge of a
historical site I would do some restoration. My main goal would be to restore
it to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point in which it was meant to look
like. By this I mean that I would do the go back to whatever it is that
needs to be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restored and apply the restoration in
minimal dozes according to what is damaged, this way I would keep the large
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; majority intact and original. Personally
I would not restore it with other colors of paint because that would not
be the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original color and this would mean that
I am not restoring it but making it my own way. I would instead try to
match the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color myself and also find out how it
was that they would come up with the colors back then and follow the same
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procedure so that I can make it as original
as possible with out overdoing it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process I learned that it is
very necessary to take all of the planning for what it is that you will
need into
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consideration since you need to submit
a proposal. This is a great excercise in which you can practice doing grant
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proposals for somewhat a real project.
You have to make decisions on what it is that you need to take such as
tools,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tents, personnel and other useful materials
for the project that you would be trying to accomplish. This excercise
gives you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the answer that you would maybe get
from a real committee for whom you are presenting your grant proposal.
There
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might be times when you will get you
proposal rejected and you have to reapply by making minor or greater changes
as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well as better decisions on what it
is that you will need. With this excersice you can also practice on what
the salary for the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crew will be and what the total amount
of people the crew will have. I think that the most important factor is
how much
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money it is that you are eligible to
get. The other important thing would be the size of the area that you would
be doing the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archaeological work. Once you know that
you can start making guestimates on how many people will be needed.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today in class we learned about the
important role that a map plays for us. We sort of saw how it is that we
work the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compass, and what it is that is needed
to be done in order to have the right coordinations set. I also learned
a little more
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about the topographic map and what are
the meanings of some of the numbers and lines that are involved with the
map.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also talked about the gps outfitters
coordinate scale, and what the numbers in this scale mean. To my surprise
I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learned today that there is evidence
that the Chinese were probably not the first to have created the compass,
and that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is evidence that the Olmecas were
a group that had used a similar method of compass.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the first time I went out to
the site and it was interesting because there was a lot of things happening
I know that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that day there was people that found
such things as tile, stucco, glass, etc. This is very important information
because this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shows that there could have existed
a wall at that location a long time ago. Hopefully next time I will get
a little more
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved and start to dig myself.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a site in which there is a lot
of intrigue for me. There are many things that I was interested in. It
is interesting to see
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the different designs throughout
the pyramids. I feel that it was a tremendous discovery by Augustus Le
Plongeon.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking about all the Religious beliefs
that people had back then is something impressive. All of the astronomical
beliefs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the way of showing gratitude is
amazing just because of the things that were done to accomplish this. The
other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impressing part of all this was the
amount of Serpents that were all around the temples. The ball court is
something that I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; am particularly interested in just because
of the different events that happened there. Thinking about the different
events
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened, such as that of the sacrificing
that took place with the different characters that had been captured.
