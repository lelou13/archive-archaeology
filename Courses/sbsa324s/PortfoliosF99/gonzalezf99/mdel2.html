<p><font face="Century Gothic">This class has been of much interest since
I read the description.&nbsp; One of the things that I have always been
interested in doing was some archaeological work.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this class
there was the opportunity to become part of the group that would go to
Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; The purpose of going to San Juan Bautista
was to do some archaeological work so that we may find some of the artifacts
that might have been lost over the years.&nbsp; Once I begin to do this
I will be able to put under my belt some experience of which I will greatly
appreciate.&nbsp; Doing all of the flintknapping labs has helped me in
making more credible guesses towards what could have happened in the past
at a certain site.</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">The other reason I am interested in doing
my project in the Mission San Juan Bautista, is because I have heard of
the way that the professor talks about the project.&nbsp; What I mean by
this is that Professor Mendoza has been involved with working with the
Mission for quite some time and he is still very excited when it comes
to talking about the archaeology work that he performs.&nbsp; Professor
Mendoza has also mentioned that he has involved students since the time
he was allowed to do this because of liability issues.&nbsp; I feel that
working at the Mission will be a lot of fun since this is also a Service
Learning class in which we go out to a community and do work.</font><font face="Century Gothic"></font>
