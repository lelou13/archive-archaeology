<p><br>Going back and remembering what it was that encouraged me to take
this class I remember that it was the fact that I wanted to finish my Science
University Learning Requirement.&nbsp; Then again I remember that I did
not want to take an ESSP class, so I looked at what was available to fulfill
this requirement and I found this class.&nbsp; This class was not only
interesting to me because of it fulfilling the requirement but also because
it dealt with archaeology, something that I had in my mind as a child.&nbsp;
I tried to find out a little more information about this class by going
to the web home page and looking at the site so that I could get a better
idea of the purpose of the class.&nbsp; While in this process I found that
the class had options of what the student wanted to do for the field project
and realized that one of the choices was doing some excavating at the Mission
of San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Working at the Mission was one of the main
reasons for which I decided to take the class.
<p>When it came to class participation I know that there were a couple
of classes in which I did not attend due to my participation in the University's
Men's varsity soccer team.&nbsp; I attended almost all of the class sessions
from which I learned different terms for use in the field of archaeology.&nbsp;
The other class participation was the online class journal.&nbsp; The online
journal was there for any student to post up what they wanted to ask, dealing
with the class and or something that they would like to share with the
rest of the class.&nbsp; My participation in the online class journal was
quite a lot since it was here were I would post what I had learned that
day in class or any questions I had.&nbsp; There were times when the online
class journal was down and this affected me in various ways.&nbsp; The
only alternative for that was sending my comments or questions directly
to Professor Mendoza.
<p>Every Friday for the past two months (Days when there was a field day),
I participated by going to the Mission for a full day since we had to attend
6 sessions. Going for a full day was a lot more beneficial because the
day was divided into two sessions so this meant that I only had to go for
a period of three days.&nbsp; Coming back to the class and posting my findings
at the Mission and how the day went was a big task, although we would catalogue
our findings while at San Juan.&nbsp; This exercise was interesting to
me because there were some items that my partner and I found, that were
very important and we felt very proud off.
<p>&nbsp;My final report…well I think that what I will do with my final
report is keep on working with it and turn it into a project that I will
do for my CST 201 Media Tools class.&nbsp; I feel that this class will
help me in doing projects for other classes.&nbsp; Some of the key concepts
that I found interesting for me where: digging, sifting, digging, and the
knowledge in the archaeological field that I gained while my excavations
at the Mission in San Juan Bautista. There was a special excavating technique
that all of the students that participated at San Juan learned.&nbsp; Sifting
became another technique that we had to learn.&nbsp; Now I am confident
that I know what to look for, unlike my first day out.&nbsp; With sifting
cataloguing has became a very good knowledge because I would learn what
the artifacts were while cataloguing and therefore I knew a lot more about
what I had to look for when digging up.&nbsp; The basic knowledge that
I have, I gained by going to class, listening to lectures, and watching
the videos that Professor Mendoza had for us.&nbsp; The readings and the
labs from which I learned the basic fundamentals of archaeology were also
of a lot of knowledge.
<p>The best labs I had where when we did the hands on parts in which I
would attempt to make tools that were available to use.&nbsp; For example
trying to come up with a blade that you chiseled down.&nbsp; But it sucked
when you would do too much and finally near the end you broke it by accident.&nbsp;
To end I think that this semester I gained a lot of knowledge and I had
a great time learning about archaeology and the concepts tied to it.&nbsp;
Thanks.
