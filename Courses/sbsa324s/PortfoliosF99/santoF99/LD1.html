<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/27/99</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In today's lecture the role maps play
in archaeology was explained. They play a major role in the documentation
of a site and it makes it easier for people in the future to find the site
again. Also when lost, using both the compass and any map will help you
figure out how to get out of the wilderness. Maps also help record the
findings on the site and make it easier to catalogue different finds.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Map Sampling</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/1/99</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this exercise I looked at areas that
were large enough for a large civilization to flourish; areas with high
altitude for the advantage in battles, being able to see an attack coming;
and water location, the people would have wanted to be fairly close to
the water, but not on top of it for fear of flooding. The over lay is line
up on the west edge of the mapped area and the north edge of the mapped
area. The following are my selections for each step and the reasons behind
the selections. 1. I selected: J12, K9, N5, G7, Q4, M13, P9, L5, M9, and
C7. I chose those squares based on the altitude and the size of the area.
The importance of the water source was not considered. I looked at the
altitude first and then I looked at the size of the area. I was thinking
about protection from battles, and having a bird's eye view of the rest
of the area. 2. The transects I selected were: F, P, N, 9, and 6. I chose
those because they ran through many of the points I chose for the first
step. That way the area could be examined for any sign of artifacts. 3.
The squares I chose were: M4, N7, C6, L5, P3, J12, M7, G8, Q5, and S8.
I chose those squares based on the altitude, area size, and the proximity
of the water source; in that order. 4. The squares I chose were: M7, N7,
P3, C6, and J12. I chose those because they didn't include any areas of
possible noise, and in my opinion they looked the best. They were condensed
from the second set of 10 squares.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Map Results</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/1/99</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">None of my selections landed on the site.
Many of my selections were right next to the sites. For my set up the results
were: G9, H9, H10, N9, N10, O9, O10, P4, Q4, O3, P2, T7, U2-7, V2-6, W3-7,
X5. Like I said, my selections were close, but not on any sites.</font></b>
