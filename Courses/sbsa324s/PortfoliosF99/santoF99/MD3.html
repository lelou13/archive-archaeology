<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In today's lecture the role maps play in
archaeology was explained. They play a major role in the documentation
of a site and it makes it easier for people in the future to find the site
again. Also when lost, using both the compass and any map will help you
figure out how to get out of the wilderness. Maps also help record the
findings on the site and make it easier to catalogue different finds.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this exercise I looked at areas that were
large enough for a large civilization to flourish; areas with high altitude
for the advantage in battles, being able to see an attack coming; and water
location, the people would have wanted to be fairly close to the water,
but not on top of it for fear of flooding. The over lay is line up on the
west edge of the mapped area and the north edge of the mapped area. The
following are my selections for each step and the reasons behind the selections.
1. I selected: J12, K9, N5, G7, Q4, M13, P9, L5, M9, and C7. I chose those
squares based on the altitude and the size of the area. The importance
of the water source was not considered. I looked at the altitude first
and then I looked at the size of the area. I was thinking about protection
from battles, and having a bird's eye view of the rest of the area. 2.
The transects I selected were: F, P, N, 9, and 6. I chose those because
they ran through many of the points I chose for the first step. That way
the area could be examined for any sign of artifacts. 3. The squares I
chose were: M4, N7, C6, L5, P3, J12, M7, G8, Q5, and S8. I chose those
squares based on the altitude, area size, and the proximity of the water
source; in that order. 4. The squares I chose were: M7, N7, P3, C6, and
J12. I chose those because they didn't include any areas of possible noise,
and in my opinion they looked the best. They were condensed from the second
set of 10 squares.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">None of my selections landed on the site.
Many of my selections were right next to the sites. For my set up the results
were: G9, H9, H10, N9, N10, O9, O10, P4, Q4, O3, P2, T7, U2-7, V2-6, W3-7,
X5. Like I said, my selections were close, but not on any sites.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Video Review</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/3/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the video I learned some of the myths
that people had in the beginning of archaeology. Just like in any area
of work, many people had biases and assumptions. They didn't want to believe
that the modern day Indians were any relation to the people who built the
magnificent mounds and made the beautiful and ornate artifacts found in
the middle of the mounds. When people first started looking at the mounds
and trying to figure out where they came from it was more enticing to think
that a long lost civilization made them then to admit that the Indians
that were being run out of their homes were responsible. In the 1800's
when the Indians were viewed as savages, and barbaric; no one wanted to
prove that they were descendants of the brilliant people responsible for
the mounds. The people who built the mounds were obviously intelligent
and could not be related to the modern day Indians. As time went on the
people began to realize the there were connections to the modern day Indians
and the moundbuilders, archaeologists began to lay to rest the idea of
a long lost people that died out maybe at the hands of the savage Indians.
I learned a lot from the video. I will add more later.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. In the video I learned some of the myths
that people had in the beginning of archaeology. Just like in any area
of work, many people had biases and assumptions. They didn't want to believe
that the modern day Indians were any relation to the people who built the
magnificent mounds and made the beautiful and ornate artifacts found in
the middle of the mounds. When people first started looking at the mounds
and trying to figure out where they came from it was more enticing to think
that a long lost civilization made them then to admit that the Indians
that were being run out of their homes were responsible. In the 1800's
when the Indians were viewed as savages, and barbaric; no one wanted to
prove that they were descendents of the brilliant people responsible for
the mounds. The people who built the mounds were obviously intelligent
and could not be related to the modern day Indians. As time went on the
people began to realize the there were connections to the modern day Indians
and the moundbuilders, archaeologists began to lay to rest the idea of
a long lost people that died out maybe at the hands of the savage Indians.
The origins of these myths come from the deep-rooted animosity towards
the Native Americans of the time. Also if they admitted that the ancestors
of the Modern Day Native Americans were responsible for the mounds then
they would lose some power over the Indians. One myth that took time to
silence was the idea that the same people built the mounds in several different
sites. This idea was based solely on the fact that there were a few small
similarities in the artifacts found within the mounds. This was later disproved,
and the people were called Hopewell and Mississippian.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. The Mound Reconstruction experiment gives
archaeologist an idea of how the mounds were built, how ling it would take,
and how many people it would take. Also the group doing the experiment
used the two different types of dumping that was evident in the mounds
that had been excavated. One way was to spread out the dirt and the other
was to just dump it. The group also placed articles in the center of the
mound just as the moundbuilders had done. The plan is that they will leave
the mound for several years and then come back and look at them and see
what happened to the mound itself and also the articles themselves.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. In regard to the Salvage Archaeology
depicted in the video I believe that it is sad that people have to rush
the excavation of a site so that another road can be built. I am glad that
people race the bulldozers, because without that much of out history would
be lost. Granted more could be learned if it was not rushed, but at least
some is learned. I believe that there is great value to the project of
salvage archaeology because the artifacts would otherwise be destroyed
in the process of building something on the land. Unfortunately because
the process is rushed the job can not be done as well, but any knowledge
gained about the history of this land is beneficial to the generations
to come.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Material Culture 1</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/7/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I would assume that the items found would
tell a lot about the people and the culture of the area. The chert core
for flaking stone tools show that the area was one where they made things.
It was possibly a work area, rather than a living area. The Spanish colonial
trade bead made of red glass could mean that the area was also used to
trade things. The bovine or capra tooth could mean the livestock was kept
near there. All three items together could mean that the area was a market
place that housed a tool laker, a trading post, and livestock areas.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Material Culture 2</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/8/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. There is a figure of a man wearing a full
jaguar or ocelot costume. He has feathers on the back of his head and he
is holding a staff with what looks like flames on the top. He could be
a priest or possibly a jaguar knight. He has large ear pieces with ornaments
dangling from the circle. The jaguar or ocelot costume combined with the
ear pieces, it is evident that he is very high in status. He is an important
figure in the tribe.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. There is also a figure of a man wearing
an eagle headdress. That was the only person I saw with the eagle headdress.
The eagle is connected with the heavens, therefore it is my contention
that he is connected to the church and is possibly a priest. He is definitely
of high status, the eagle was a sacred symbol and not just anyone could
wear it.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. On one panel there were three symbols
which looked like a modern day compass. In the line the symbol was above
the other drawings. It could have been a calendar or sundial, but it had
points that seemed to mark N, S, E, and W.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. There was also the figure of a man with
a jaguar or ocelot headdress and one hand was missing and the other was
like the paw of a large cat. He has both nose and ear pieces, and a beard.
He was the only one I saw with a beard. The other images were of clean-shaven
men. It is my impression that he is of high status. He has several articles
that give me the idea that he is high in status.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">5. There was another man with a jaguar headdress
and one hand was a paw instead of a hand. He also seemed to be wearing
armor. He could be a jaguar knight. He seemed to be a fighter, with the
armor and the paw for a hand.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">6. There was also the image of a carcass
of, I believe an animal that was spread out and the skin was separated
from the bones. You could see the bones lying in the middle of the skin.
It was like the way the skins of animals were dried out to use for clothing
and other things. It could be showing their practice of using all parts
of the animals.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/10/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first artifacts I received were very
different. The first one is brownish red in color and roughly 1.5" - 2"
in length. Side A is fairly smooth, but it has been worked to form sharp
edges. There are very few hard edges, where flaking has occurred on the
face, and there is a peak in the center that slopes to the edges. The edges
are smooth for the most part. It appears that the tip is missing and the
bottom has one large notch opposite the point. Side B is smooth except
for one small area that appears to be broke off a large rock. This side
doesn't appear to have been worked. It resembles the Archaic Humbolt Basal-notch
(b), 7,850 - 2,500 B.P. This piece might have been used for a spear point,
or as a hand-held cutting tool. The second artifact is gray in color over
the majority of it except for a small area on the left side of the base,
which is red/pink. It is roughly 1" - 1.25" in length. The flaking appears
to be done in the all directions, and it appears to be fairly asymmetrical.
The edges are rough, like a serrated knife. There are grooves on the sides
near the base for the tie to go around when assembling a spear or arrow.
It resembles Late Plains Archaic Kobold Site (a) 3,100 - 1,400 B.P. The
two pieces are different in almost all ways.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Artifact 1.10 The artifact I looked at was
many different colors. The colors were 5yr 6/1, 7/1, &amp; 7/2. The prominent
color was 6/1, a pinkish gray, was mainly the center and one side. On the
base the main color is 7/1 a lighter gray, less pink. On the other edge
the main color is 7/2 which is a lighter gray with more pink.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/15/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Artifact 1.10: both sides a and b are secondary
and show some cortex. Most of the cortex is on the proximal end, and the
distal end is rounded and leads to cerated edges. The flaking appears to
have been done on both sides, but much of the attention was on the edges.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flintknapping Video</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/29/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was impressed by the way that many different
tools could be made from just one piece of material. Unlike today where
we have a different knife for every different thing imaginable and they
are all made from different items, the people who used stone tools recycled
the broken tools and made new ones each time a new task was set upon them.
Once the tool broke instead of throwing it away and starting all over again
they just chipped more away and used it again for something else. They
just reshaped the tool to perform any kind of work that needed to be done.
Many people believe that the people from thousands of years ago were not
as intelligent as people of today. But I feel that they were very intelligent.
They were able to make tools from hunks of rock with their bare hands.
They also used the tool until there was nothing left but some flakes. When
the edge got dull, they sharpened it; when the spear point broke, they
reshaped it to use again and again. Unlike today where if something is
broke and can not be fixed it is thrown away. I was also intrigued by the
way that he could predict the way that the flake would come off. He could
get exactly the shape he wanted by hitting the rock in just the right way.
There is a use of physics involved in flintknapping. The toolmaker needs
to know how the rock is going to break, and that comes from experience
and experimentation. Once they know how the rock will break and what tools
and techniques make it break a certain way then they can make tools with
little or no effort because they know just how to hit it. It was interesting
to see the different techniques used in the toolmaking. It was also interesting
to see the different tools being used. I was able to see exactly how they
worked and what kind of flakes they produced.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Site Grid: Archaeologists stake and line
full squares starting from the datum point, and it makes the grid permanent.
Datum: A fixed reference point for the excavation making the mapping procedure
easier and also giving people the same point of perspective. Also when
someone goes back months later they can find exactly what the others had
noted, and therefore no confusion is made between different archaeologists.
Sampling Strategy: Archaeologists sample and excavate various small units
within a larger unit to determine whether there is anything of importance
in the area. They can then determine whether it is worth the time, the
money, and the effort to excavate any further or to move onto another site.
Soil Analysis: Archaeologists take a soil sample and analyze the composition
of it to determine of there was human habitation there. Transect or Pedestrian
Surveys: Walking straight lines to find surface evidence of human habitation.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">LD 5 Reading Review</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/30/99</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. During the search for the "Lost Spanish
Mission" David Hurst Thomas and his team used many different tools and
procedures. They started by using the transect sampling strategy. He and
his team walked a series of 31 east-west transects, each 100 meters wide.
The survey turned up 135 mostly unrecorded archaeological sites. Then they
investigated each site with tow or more 1-meter-square test units. They
excavated more than 400 test pits. With the test pits they were able to
see if there was anything in the area that was worth a total excavation
or if they should move on. They next used a gasoline-powered posthole digger
and they excavated hundreds of round holes. The machine can dig a 3-foot-deep
hole in less than a minute. The power auger throws up a sample of dirt
to be hand-sifted for artifacts. They then used a proton precession magnetometer.
The magnetometer measures the strength of magnetism between the earth's
magnetic core and a sensor controlled by the archaeologist. Once hundreds
of these readings have been done then a computer plotter can generate a
magnetic contour map reflecting both the shape and the intensity of magnetic
anomalies beneath the ground surface. There were many advantages gained
from the use of the tools and the procedures done. One main one was that
they were using, for the most part non-destructive methods, therefore preserving
the land until they were fairly sure where they wanted to excavate the
main site. Also by trying different tools and techniques they opened themselves
up to many possible sites and discoveries they otherwise would have missed
because they only used one or two types of tools and procedures. I believe
that the methods employed were successful in that they found what they
were looking for in a timely fashion and they did not destroy any land
in the process of searching for the "Lost Spanish Mission."</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. Thomas and his crew first divided St.
Catherine’s Island into 31 transects and these horizontal imaginary lines
that transected the island. They were used so that the researchers could
conceptualize their research area. By dividing the island into smaller
portions, they were able to assign different areas to different people,
making them responsible for that small area. They also made the work areas
realistic and not seem like to large to excavate completely. The rationalization
of being able to conceptualize the research area are why archaeologists
dig square holes. Test pits tend to be one-meter squares that can descend
into the ground for many feet. Researchers are able to add a third dimension
to their findings when they make these pits, i.e.; front to back, side
to side, and top to bottom. These pits also give the archaeologist an idea
as to how the artifacts relate to each other within the area.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. Ethnoarchaeology, Garbology, and Experimental
Archaeology all add to the concept of Middle Range Research. Basically
Middle Range Research is where archaeologists look at what they know about
the cultures of yesterday and compare them to today's culture. It creates
a link between the cultures of today and yesterday. Ethnoarchaeology is
where the archaeologist goes into the particular culture and lives as they
live and they make assumptions about the generations that have come before
them. They see how the people are living now and they relate that to the
way that they lived in the past. Also they get information from the people
of the culture. They learn some of the oral history that has been passed
down through the ages. Garbology allows the archaeologist to learn about
the culture through the garbage left behind. From the garbage they can
learn about the diet from the bones, seed, and shells from food. They can
also learn about the clothes and tools used from the broken tools that
were thrown away and pieces of clothing and material. Just little remnants
of food, clothing, and tools can provide information about how the people
of that culture lived. Experimental Archaeology is where the archaeologists
try doing things as the people from the past might have done them. One
example is the mound builders experiment. A group of archaeologists and
students create a mound using the techniques that were evident from the
excavated mounds. They learned about the process by going through it. It
allows the archaeologist to experience things from a different perspective.
This allows them to see first hand how they build or made things. All of
these provide insight into how past generations lived and what connections
there are to today's culture. It provides the missing link.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately I was unable to attend class
last Thursday because I was ill. From what I understand it was a really
interesting lab. From the previous lab I observed the amount of knowledge
you must have about the material and the tool you are making. It takes
a lot of practice to know just how to hit the stone in order for it to
break just right. I hope that I will have a chance to go to another lab
to work with stone tools in the future.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
