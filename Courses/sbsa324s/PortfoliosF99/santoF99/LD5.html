<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. During the search for the "Lost Spanish
Mission" David Hurst Thomas and his team used many different tools and
procedures. They started by using the transect sampling strategy. He and
his team walked a series of 31 east-west transects, each 100 meters wide.
The survey turned up 135 mostly unrecorded archaeological sites. Then they
investigated each site with tow or more 1-meter-square test units. They
excavated more than 400 test pits. With the test pits they were able to
see if there was anything in the area that was worth a total excavation
or if they should move on. They next used a gasoline-powered posthole digger
and they excavated hundreds of round holes. The machine can dig a 3-foot-deep
hole in less than a minute. The power auger throws up a sample of dirt
to be hand-sifted for artifacts. They then used a proton precession magnetometer.
The magnetometer measures the strength of magnetism between the earth's
magnetic core and a sensor controlled by the archaeologist. Once hundreds
of these readings have been done then a computer plotter can generate a
magnetic contour map reflecting both the shape and the intensity of magnetic
anomalies beneath the ground surface. There were many advantages gained
from the use of the tools and the procedures done. One main one was that
they were using, for the most part non-destructive methods, therefore preserving
the land until they were fairly sure where they wanted to excavate the
main site. Also by trying different tools and techniques they opened themselves
up to many possible sites and discoveries they otherwise would have missed
because they only used one or two types of tools and procedures. I believe
that the methods employed were successful in that they found what they
were looking for in a timely fashion and they did not destroy any land
in the process of searching for the "Lost Spanish Mission."</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. Thomas and his crew first divided St.
Catherine’s Island into 31 transects and these horizontal imaginary lines
that transected the island. They were used so that the researchers could
conceptualize their research area. By dividing the island into smaller
portions, they were able to assign different areas to different people,
making them responsible for that small area. They also made the work areas
realistic and not seem like to large to excavate completely. The rationalization
of being able to conceptualize the research area are why archaeologists
dig square holes. Test pits tend to be one-meter squares that can descend
into the ground for many feet. Researchers are able to add a third dimension
to their findings when they make these pits, i.e.; front to back, side
to side, and top to bottom. These pits also give the archaeologist an idea
as to how the artifacts relate to each other within the area.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. Ethnoarchaeology, Garbology, and Experimental
Archaeology all add to the concept of Middle Range Research. Basically
Middle Range Research is where archaeologists look at what they know about
the cultures of yesterday and compare them to today's culture. It creates
a link between the cultures of today and yesterday. Ethnoarchaeology is
where the archaeologist goes into the particular culture and lives as they
live and they make assumptions about the generations that have come before
them. They see how the people are living now and they relate that to the
way that they lived in the past. Also they get information from the people
of the culture. They learn some of the oral history that has been passed
down through the ages. Garbology allows the archaeologist to learn about
the culture through the garbage left behind. From the garbage they can
learn about the diet from the bones, seed, and shells from food. They can
also learn about the clothes and tools used from the broken tools that
were thrown away and pieces of clothing and material. Just little remnants
of food, clothing, and tools can provide information about how the people
of that culture lived. Experimental Archaeology is where the archaeologists
try doing things as the people from the past might have done them. One
example is the mound builders experiment. A group of archaeologists and
students create a mound using the techniques that were evident from the
excavated mounds. They learned about the process by going through it. It
allows the archaeologist to experience things from a different perspective.
This allows them to see first hand how they build or made things. All of
these provide insight into how past generations lived and what connections
there are to today's culture. It provides the missing link.</font>
