<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to have the
opportunity to reflect on the semester thus far.&nbsp; I am really enjoying
my time so far in the class.&nbsp; I am able to learn more about an area
of Social Science that I have been interested in for a long time.&nbsp;
I have gone fossil hunting and have gone exploring old Native American
ruins.&nbsp; My purpose for enrolling in this class was one to fulfill
half of my Science ULR and two to expand my knowledge on a subject that
has interested my since I was a little girl.&nbsp; In completing the assignments
required I will complete my Science ULR.&nbsp; As far as expanding my general
knowledge of archaeology I feel that each day I am learning more about
the field.&nbsp; Through the readings and the lectures I am learning about
the different aspects of archaeology.&nbsp; So far I am pleased with the
knowledge that I am gaining and I feel confident that I will complete my
Science ULR and continue to learn throughout the rest of the semester.</font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately I have
had serious health problems this semester and I have missed a couple of
classes.&nbsp; I have kept in contact with several classmates and they
have filled me in on what I missed.&nbsp; I have completed every Lab Deliverable
that has been assigned.&nbsp; I will be doing a Garbology project and we
have not started yet, so I have not completed any Field Deliverables.&nbsp;
I have worked very hard on each of the Deliverables and even when I missed
class I made sure that I knew what was going on and what was due.&nbsp;
I use the Online Journal almost every class day.&nbsp; Whenever there is
a lecture, or activity in class that I feel the need to comment on I do.&nbsp;
I also use it to complete my Lab Deliverables.&nbsp; I feel that I have
responded appropriately to the questions posed in class that were to be
answered in the Online Journal.&nbsp; Once in a while I feel that I don’t
have much to say and then other times I have a lot to say.&nbsp; It varies,
but when I am really into a subject I write a lot more.&nbsp; I am preparing
for my final project report by beginning to find good sources of info about
Garbology.&nbsp; I have found several web sites and intend to find more
databases to use as resources in my project.&nbsp; It is difficult to find
web sites that are helpful in anyway.&nbsp; Most of the sites I have found
give definitions and one or two give directions on how to do an experiment.&nbsp;
I am going to keep looking for resources including books and articles.&nbsp;
I intend to do a Garbology Lab on someone on campus.&nbsp; I have a partner
that I will work with.&nbsp; We have discussed many different options for
the subject to study, but we have not come up with an answer.&nbsp; We
will decide soon who we will use in our study and of course we will get
their permission before we start anything.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been interested
by the ways in which archaeologists use trash to learn about a past culture.&nbsp;
They take what they get from the dirt in the way of waste and then they
determine what they ate, how they got the food, and what kinds of clothes
they wore.&nbsp; It seemed really interesting to me how much people can
learn by studying people’s trash.&nbsp; Also I was really surprised when
Professor Mendoza did a slide show and lecture about the Anastazi ruins
in Arizona.&nbsp; I went there when I was ten or eleven and that was one
of the best experiences of my life.&nbsp; I hiked down to an immense cliff
dwelling in Northern Arizona.&nbsp; It was a rough hike, but it was worth
it.&nbsp; Hearing Professor Mendoza’s explanation of the different pieces
of the ruins helped me understand what I saw as child.&nbsp; There was
a tour guide explaining things, but I was so young that I don’t remember
the explanations, but I do remember the ruins.&nbsp; I also have gone through
Monument Valley and I really enjoyed the stories we were told by the native
people.&nbsp; I was also really interested by the lecture and slide show
about the different tribes in Mexico and the similarities between cultures
that were separated by large areas.&nbsp; I also like the Stone Tools Lab.&nbsp;
I was intrigued to learn how the tools are made and the way that a skilled
toolmaker can predict how the stone will break.&nbsp; There has not been
a lecture or reading that has been boring to me.&nbsp; But the ones that
I mentioned above are the ones that really interested me.&nbsp; I am really
interested in archaeology and I am glad that I have this opportunity to
learn more about something I already enjoy.</font>
