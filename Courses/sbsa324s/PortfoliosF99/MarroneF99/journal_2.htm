the atronomical beliefs of these people are very interesting. I also found
that the ball court was also intrequing. Just to know that sports and recreation
was a big part of thier lives, as it is in our own society. However, brutal
sacrifices are not part of our sports like in thiers. The designs in the
pyramids were also very magical and mysterious which also grabs my attention.
It also occurd to me that serpants were a big part of thier religion as
well, since they were diagramed within their vast temples.</font></td>

<td BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial">The lost spanish mission was led
by David Hurst Thomas and his crew of coliques. They used a transect sampling
strategy where they would walk west and east transects which measured 100
meteres wide. In every site they doug two or more 1 meter square units
( which were test units ) and as many as 400 pits. With a gas powered posthole
digger they were able to excavate hundreds of holes which were about 3
feet deep. Power augers were also used to throw dirt up for sampling. Another
tool that was used was a proton procession magnetometer which measures
the magnetism between the earths magnetic core and the sensor on the machine.
These tools increased the teams productivity tremendously. It gave faster
and more acurate results which saves time and money. Not only did it do
these things but they used tools that would not hurt the environment in
order for it to be preserved for future generations. Thomas states that
conceptualizing and rationalizing the research area is why they they dig
sites. Not only that but it gives the team an good idea as to how objects
found are related to each other. Middle range research is made up of Ethnoarchaeology,
garbology, and experimental archaeology. To be an ethnoarchaeologist you
must live amongst the people you are studying and make assumptions about
the people who used to live there. Garbology is the study of peoples trash.
By this you can tell everything to a persons diet to their sexual activities.
Experimental archaeology is doing things in such a way that it was believed
to have been done in the past according to gathered data.</font></td>

<td BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial">I personaly find garbology very
fascinating. From one persons trash you can depict exactly what kind of
food they are eating, how much they are eating, and if they are concerned
about their diet. You can also tell thier sexuality, their daily activities,
how much alcohol they consume, and how many people or animlas might live
in one residence. From the video and lecture today I also learned that
you can depict a persons religion, financial background, and thier culture.
However I do feel that it is an intrusion of privacy if the person, or
persons, are not informed. I would be extremely upset if I knew someone
was going through my trash. Not because I am afraid of what they might
find, but because it is my trash and if I wanted people to look through
it I would not put it in a black bag. Although garbology is extremely helpfull
in determining the dietary status of our culture and should be used to
help not hurt.&nbsp;</font></td>
