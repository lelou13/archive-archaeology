<b><u>Final Term Paper Outline and Notes</u></b>
<p><br>
<p><b><i>A brief overview and history</i>:</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flintknapping is the most common and
widspread name for the age-old craft of making</b>
<br><b>stone tools.&nbsp; Not just making a stone tool, however it is better
said to flake a stone tool.&nbsp; Most</b>
<br><b>knappers of the present learn this process through hands on experience
and gaining the knowledge</b>
<br><b>and understanding of why and how stones break or flake.&nbsp; However,
Paleolithic hunters and</b>
<br><b>gathers knew nothing of shock waves or measuring the angles of the
platform in which the stone</b>
<br><b>would flake better.&nbsp; It was strickly based on practiced eyes
and hands that could judge what</b>
<br><b>would work and what would fail.&nbsp; For the knappers of our time
it is better to have the</b>
<br><b>understanding of the basic principles and terminology in order to
know why the techniques work</b>
<br><b>or dont work.&nbsp; In other words what stones are best for flaking,
what are the best angles in which</b>
<br><b>to properly strike, and how much force should be used to get the
desired flake.&nbsp; All of these must</b>
<br><b>be considered before this process can begin.&nbsp; During the early
1800s this process was used</b>
<br><b>tremenously among the British for making gunflints by breaking long
flakes into short pieces.</b>
<br><b>This was also precieved at the time were archaeology was just developing
into a science and stone</b>
<br><b>tools were starting to be recognized as ancient artifacts of prehistoric
humans. It seems that the</b>
<br><b>ways in which prehistorians vs. modern day flintnappers went about
flaking there stone tools,</b>
<br><b>using there own techniques, and producing the same types of flakes
is learned through experiance.</b>
<br><b>However it is said that a basic understanding of the tools as well
as the process is necessary to</b>
<br><b>utilize the concept of this ancient craft.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the art of knapping is to
share the same techniques used by the earliest of man.</b>
<br><b>This is most likely the oldest form of weaponry and craftsmanship
that has been discovered.</b>
<br><b>However, the needs of hunter gather groups greatly surpases our
needs for these types of stone</b>
<br><b>tools.&nbsp; They were aware of the usfull techniques as well as
the faulty ones that created these usfull</b>
<br><b>tools but only from a succeed or fail method.&nbsp; They had no
concept of angles or platforms, only</b>
<br><b>the concept of survival was present.&nbsp; Present day knappers
have a great advantage over thier</b>
<br><b>ancestors.&nbsp; They have the knowledge of knowing the precise
angles and needed pressure as well</b>
<br><b>as the terminoly to make the exact flake or notch.&nbsp; However
the only true way to explore these</b>
<br><b>methods is by experience.&nbsp; Like every other craft this too
must take practice and patience before it</b>
<br><b>is masterd.&nbsp; Although it is extremely helpfull to know exactly
why and how flakes break of</b>
<br><b>different stones when force is applied.&nbsp; It is also neccessary
to know what stones are most likely</b>
<br><b>to produce a more suitable flake.&nbsp; The best way to learn how
to make stone tools is not just</b>
<br><b>simply doing your homwork on platforms, angles, bifaces, notches,
flakes, shock waves etc, but</b>
<br><b>rather experience.</b>
<p><b><i>Basic necessities of a Flintnapper</i></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One necessity for a flintknapper is that
the stone have one basic quality, it has to fracture</b>
<br><b>conchidly in order for the stone not to crack and create other flaws.&nbsp;
To fracture conchidly means</b>
<br><b>that the fracture surfaces are curved like a cockle shell.&nbsp;
By changing the shape and varying the</b>
<br><b>angles and force used on the stone, the fracture can be controlled
and minipulated to the</b>
<br><b>flintknappes disier.&nbsp; Stones that will fracture conchidly are
thus desirable for flaking and share</b>
<br><b>similare qualities.&nbsp; The stone has to be brittle and homogeneous,
which means that the stone is the</b>
<br><b>same throughout its shape lacking impurities in texture, planes,
cracks, and flaws.&nbsp; Stones that do</b>
<br><b>not fit this discription will not fracture conchidly but will ultimitely
crack or break when force is</b>
<br><b>applied.</b>
<p><b><i>How to be productive as a Flintknapper:</i></b><b></b>
<p><b>To acurrately be productive as a flintknapper there are several key
concepts that need to</b>
<br><b>be understood.&nbsp; Cores, which is the piece on the rock in which
you strike, and flakes, which are</b>
<br><b>the pieces which come off after pressure and force have been administered.&nbsp;
The fracture surface</b>
<br><b>of the flake contains certain features such as the ventral and the
dorsal surfaces.&nbsp; The ventral</b>
<br><b>meaning belly, and the dorsal meaning back.&nbsp; The surface at
the top of the flake were the initial</b>
<br><b>blow occured is called the platform.&nbsp; This is also the proximal
end while the opposite is the distal</b>
<br><b>end.&nbsp; If the stone was hit by a hard hamer stone there would
likely be a small crushed area called</b>
<br><b>the point of percussion, most likely on the platform.&nbsp; Ring
cracks, which are small round cracks,</b>
<br><b>may also appear on the top of the cone.&nbsp; Just below the interior
fracture surface of the flake</b>
<br><b>swelling will appear while further down ripples, which are the center
of the point of percusion,</b>
<br><b>will also appear.&nbsp; The force applied to the rock sends waves
through its interior which creates</b>
<br><b>these ripples and flakes.&nbsp; You can also determine which direction
the flake was removed by</b>
<br><b>inspecting the flake scares, which are curved lines were the flake
originally was formed to the</b>
<br><b>rock.&nbsp; Radial fissures are also commonly seen on the interior
surfaces of flakes.&nbsp; These fissures are</b>
<br><b>tiny cracks that are pointed back twords the point were the stone
was struck.&nbsp; Parasitic flake</b>
<br><b>scares are also left behind and can be seen when a small leaf shaped
flake is removed when the</b>
<br><b>stone is struck.&nbsp; The concept of knapping is really quit simple.&nbsp;
A good knapper can easily control</b>
<br><b>the force of the blow being applied, the direction, the point of
impact, the shape he/she wants of</b>
<br><b>the core, and the angles of edges.&nbsp; With every strike the conditions
of the rock change thus the</b>
<br><b>angles and the pressure being applied must change as well</b>
<p><b><i>Different techniques of napping:</i></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to create these types of flakes
along with others is by using a hard-hammer</b>
<br><b>method, by striking one rock with another.&nbsp; This is a very
basic principle of knapping and requires</b>
<br><b>large pieces of material for best results.&nbsp; The hammer which
is used should be lighter than the core</b>
<br><b>it is striking, because the size of the hammer will affect the size
of the flakes produced.&nbsp; Since</b>
<br><b>hammer stones will also break it is best to have several handy.&nbsp;
The best type of hammer stones</b>
<br><b>are stream rounded pebbles that are less brittle and will not likely
shatter when being struck</b>
<br><b>against another rock.&nbsp; Stones such as chert and obsidian will
not make good hammer stones</b>
<br><b>because with each use the surface of the rock is ruduced to an irregular
surface.&nbsp; Rocks that</b>
<br><b>contain cracks or flaws should not be used.&nbsp; Different knappers
use differetn stones depending on</b>
<br><b>their preferance, however, the main point is that there should be
a noticable spot or point on the</b>
<br><b>hamerstone in which to strike.&nbsp; Over time hammerstones aquire
wear patterns that can be easily</b>
<br><b>depicted.&nbsp; If used frequently the stone will also develope
polished grips were your finqures are</b>
<br><b>usually placed.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressure flaking is another technique
used by knappers which uses pressure to remove</b>
<br><b>portions of the stone.&nbsp; This technique is used with a flaker,
or a deer antler, and instead of hiting</b>
<br><b>the stone you simply press the antler against the core causing small
pieces to break as a result of</b>
<br><b>added presure.&nbsp; The platform used for this technique is not
a flat surface but a ridge.&nbsp; The angle</b>
<br><b>used is still less than 90 degrees, however, the angle is formed
against the edge itself and is</b>
<br><b>applied almost parrellel to the centerplane.&nbsp; The ideal platform
is just above the face in which you</b>
<br><b>intend to remove a flake and slightly below the other.&nbsp; A bifacial
edge is also ideal but takes more</b>
<br><b>time to construct.&nbsp; A helpful technique within this method
is called shearing, which involves</b>
<br><b>crushing flakes off the edge with the side of the antler.&nbsp;
Another technique called buffering, uses</b>
<br><b>the flaker in one direction away from the face were you are flaking
to pull of different flakes.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>is also a way of dulling the edges of the core.&nbsp; Pressure flaking
is also a good way to create</b>
<br><b>notches in your flakes, such as in projectile points.&nbsp; This
is done by repeadedly removing edges</b>
<br><b>from both sides of the face which creates deep and narrow notches.&nbsp;
The tip of the antler or flaker</b>
<br><b>is the most commonly used for this type of technique.&nbsp; In order
to create an ideal notch downward</b>
<br><b>pressure should be administered and the platform should be at the
centerplane.&nbsp; Small broad flakes</b>
<br><b>will be removed when this technique is used properly.&nbsp; To sum
up the pressure flaking technique</b>
<br><b>one should remember a few essential methods.&nbsp; The pressure
is applied to the edge of the piece,</b>
<br><b>which is the platform, and should be of an angle less than 90 degrees.&nbsp;
The flaker should be placed</b>
<br><b>on the edge with force applied in the direction the flake is to
be removed.&nbsp; Edges should be dull</b>
<br><b>enough to crush and biface all thick edges and right angles.&nbsp;
The last thing to remember is that the</b>
<br><b>platform should be below the centerplane of the piece you are working
with.</b></blockquote>
