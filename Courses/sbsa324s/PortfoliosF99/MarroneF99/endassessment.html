<b><u>End Term Self Assessment</u></b></blockquote>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of this
semester I learned a tremendous amount of valuable information</b>
<br><b>that will stick with me as I progress through this university (
or others if transferring becomes an</b>
<br><b>option ) and through gradschool.&nbsp; Since middle school I have
been fascinated with how ancient</b>
<br><b>cultures thrived in different areas of the world.&nbsp; My interests
led me into my first archaeology</b>
<br><b>class were we learned the basics of excavating a particular site.&nbsp;
However, the materials that we</b>
<br><b>found turned out to be the same materials found in previous courses.&nbsp;
During high school no such</b>
<br><b>courses were available but I cured my hunger by exploring old pioneer
ruins within my parents 40</b>
<br><b>acres of property.&nbsp; When I entered Junior college I immediately
enrolled in a physical</b>
<br><b>anthropology class which not only taught me the basics of anthropology,
but the basics of college</b>
<br><b>work as well.&nbsp; I followed this up by taking cultural anthropology
and a sociology course which</b>
<br><b>also taught me valuable lessons.&nbsp; This is the main reason why
I enrolled in your course and I truly</b>
<br><b>regret not being able to venture with the class on the San Jaun
Babtista digs.&nbsp; My only excuse is a</b>
<br><b>strenuous schedule of both a full time student and an athlete.&nbsp;
Conflicting schedules made it</b>
<br><b>difficult for me to join the class on the digs.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However I found that the stone tool
labs were very interesting and informational.&nbsp; Since I</b>
<br><b>was a young boy in cub scouts I loved finding grinding stones, arrow
heads, and other Indian</b>
<br><b>artifacts.&nbsp; Although I never learned the concept being making
these types of tools and the real</b>
<br><b>importance behind them.&nbsp; By having hands on experience making
stone tools as well as in depth</b>
<br><b>research I have now satisfied my curiosity.&nbsp; I am sorry to
say that I did not get into the garbology</b>
<br><b>project for a few personal reasons.&nbsp; For one I really just
did not want to dig through someone’s</b>
<br><b>garbage, and two it would give me flash backs of horrible dump trips
with my father.&nbsp; My father</b>
<br><b>wasn’t the problem, it was the monthly build-up of horrible smelling
and appalling garbage that</b>
<br><b>we would have to haul.&nbsp; Since we lived outside of town we would
have to take our garbage to the</b>
<br><b>dump ourselves, and sometimes we would only do it once every couple
of months.&nbsp; However I do</b>
<br><b>find garbology fascinating in the fact that you can tell so much
about one persons life style.</b>
<br><b>Everything from their diet, their sexual activities, alcohol consumption,
hygiene, etc.&nbsp; And I did</b>
<br><b>enjoy the stories of past classes searching through the university
staffs trash and finding</b>
<br><b>condemning material.&nbsp; Learning this makes me very causous of
what I through away.</b>
<br><b>I also enjoyed learning about the ancient mound people and the myths
that went along</b>
<br><b>with them.&nbsp; I found the connection between these mounds and
with the ancient pyramids of</b>
<br><b>Egypt.&nbsp; Both societies used these type of constructions for
ritual as well as burial purposes.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>each structure only the most important people within the society
were laid to rest.&nbsp; Along with the</b>
<br><b>diseased were artifacts that contain certain personal or religious
meaning.&nbsp; Learning about the</b>
<br><b>ancient Myan civilizations also caught my attention.&nbsp; The idea
of sacrifice and astronomical</b>
<br><b>relevance was very intriguing.&nbsp; While I was visiting Cozumel/Playa
del Carmen I visited the</b>
<br><b>ancient Mayan ruins and found that there was a number of temples
for sacrifice as well as</b>
<br><b>astronomical relevance.&nbsp; There was one structure that when
the sun set or rose it would cast a</b>
<br><b>beam of light through a small hole of the structure and sent it
into the back of a different</b>
<br><b>structure.&nbsp; This was of either for sacrifice or a calendar
of some sort, but it was too long ago to</b>
<br><b>remember.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another part of the course that I
enjoyed was the slides you prepared.&nbsp; Especially the</b>
<br><b>slides of the low-riders that you documented.&nbsp; I also learned
allot about the patterns of graffiti art</b>
<br><b>work and simple vandalism.&nbsp; Learning this forces one to be
open minded about what other</b>
<br><b>cultures or generations feels as art and ways of expression.&nbsp;
It was also fascinating to learn the</b>
<br><b>level of education with simple vandalism.&nbsp; Such as the documentation
of bathroom walls in a</b>
<br><b>junior college and a University.&nbsp; The junior college seemed
to be more derogatory towards gender</b>
<br><b>and race, while the University seemed to be more political.&nbsp;
Thus diagramming, in a sense, the</b>
<br><b>level of education.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I found that the on-line
journals to be very confusing and frustrating.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>had to re-due several entries because of my lack of knowledge about
the computer.&nbsp; I also found</b>
<br><b>it hard to completely express my feelings in the short amount of
time we had to enter them.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>is why some entries are short or just not present at all.&nbsp;
This was my first experience with the</b>
<br><b>on-line journal so it was difficult.&nbsp; I had also forgotten
to enter journal entries after every lab</b>
<br><b>exercise, and feel that it is too late to do so.&nbsp; I also found
it hard to find information about stone</b>
<br><b>tools for my final project.&nbsp; Every web page that I searched
through only contained information</b>
<br><b>about buying or selling pieces.&nbsp; There was no general background
or history in which to get an</b>
<br><b>idea from.&nbsp; However I was able to use my notes, as well as
colloquies notes, and a few documents</b>
<br><b>which you handed out.&nbsp; I searched through a few books from
the library and received a few</b>
<br><b>general ideas.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall I truly enjoyed this course and
deeply regret that I did not put my entire heart and soul</b>
<br><b>into it.&nbsp; I feel that I would of obtained more out of the class
if I could of attended the San Juan</b>
<br><b>digs.&nbsp; And I also regret not communicating during class sessions
because I know its hard talking</b>
<br><b>to a group of students who don’t voice their opinions.&nbsp; My
father was a high school teacher and I</b>
<br><b>watched him struggle with students my entire life.&nbsp; I relies
that I have to start participating more</b>
<br><b>in class discussions in order to make it through these tough college
years.&nbsp; I also understand that it</b>
<br><b>makes it easier for the professors as well.</b></blockquote>
