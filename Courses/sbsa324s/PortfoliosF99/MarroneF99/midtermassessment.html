<br><b><u>Major Deliverable 1: Midterm Self Assessment</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My purpose for enrolling in
the SBSA 324s From Map to Museum is to continue</b>
<br><b>my study in the area of anthropology and ethnography.&nbsp; I felt
that by enrolling in this course it</b>
<br><b>would give me broader scope in my specific area of study.&nbsp;
Since 8th grade I have been fascinated</b>
<br><b>by the study of our species and this fascination was fueled by my
first archeology class.&nbsp; In junior</b>
<br><b>college I studied both physical and cultural anthropology as well
as an introduction to sociology.</b>
<br><b>It is because of these classes that I have chosen the social and
behavioral science major.&nbsp; However</b>
<br><b>I feel that this class is not what I intended it to be, maybe because
I am used to more of a research</b>
<br><b>approach to the study of humans.&nbsp; Although I do enjoy the hands
on labs where we get to dabble</b>
<br><b>in the making of stone tools.</b>
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do enjoy the lab exercises
and I feel that they help us grasp the concepts better,</b>
<br><b>but I find it hard to make it to every session.&nbsp; Since I have
a very rigorous schedule of 19 units</b>
<br><b>and I am a student athlete I feel that if I am not completing assignments
in a particular class or</b>
<br><b>taking notes for an exam I should be studying for another class.&nbsp;
However soccer season is</b>
<br><b>winding down so I will be able to make it to all of the class sessions.</b>
<p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have used the online journal
effectively to some extent except that it frustrates me</b>
<br><b>tremendously.&nbsp; I have lost several journals now because I wasn’t
paying attention or I pushed the</b>
<br><b>wrong button, or maybe its just that I am not computer friendly.&nbsp;
But the comments that I have</b>
<br><b>presented in the journals I thought were well thought out for the
short time we had to write them.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I feel that I am holding back because I am not use to
everyone reading my</b>
<br><b>assignments.&nbsp; This is the first time I have ever used a online
journal and to be honest it makes me</b>
<br><b>nervous to know that anyone, enrolled in the class or not, can read
my thoughts.</b>
<p><b>4 &amp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest I have
not really thought to hard about the final project, however I</b>
<br><b>have thought about choosing the lab option.&nbsp; The garbology
lab might be a good and interesting</b>
<br><b>idea for me, but it will be a little messy.&nbsp; I find it fascinating
that you can tell so much about one</b>
<br><b>individual just from their garbage.&nbsp; If I do the research project
I will most likely do it on stone</b>
<br><b>tools since we spent so much time in class on it.&nbsp; However
I do not think I will feel confident</b>
<br><b>enough about that subject to write an entire term paper consisting
of 8-10 pages.&nbsp; Sure we spent</b>
<br><b>allot of time in class on it, but there is not allot of material
to write on.</b>
<p><b>6 &amp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the stone
tools lab very interesting and exciting because I find hands on</b>
<br><b>material very stimulating.&nbsp; I love being able to actually apply
what we have learned in class into</b>
<br><b>the field.&nbsp; If I don intend to write a research paper on stone
tools I will definitely reflect on the</b>
<br><b>days we spent in the lab actually making those tools.&nbsp; I would
incorporate that into my paper to</b>
<br><b>give any reader a more detailed look into the making of stone tools.&nbsp;
However if I was to take</b>
<br><b>another archaeology class I would like to see more of the hands
on labs.&nbsp; But more of the actual</b>
<br><b>digging and exploring like at San Juan Babtista.&nbsp; I would have
loved to be able to attend those</b>
<br><b>sessions but my schedule would not allow it.</b>
<p><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I stated in the previous paragraphs
I will try to improve my performance in</b>
<br><b>the class room as well as in the lab.&nbsp; I feel that I need to
improve my attitude in class by means of</b>
<br><b>vocal ability.&nbsp; Since I am extremely shy when it comes to public
speaking it is hard to voice my</b>
<br><b>opinion in class.&nbsp; I will try harder and I will definitely
improve my attendance so I can complete</b>
<br><b>this course with a high grade.&nbsp; I feel that my strengths lie
in my writing ability, since I am not at all</b>
<br><b>vocal the only way to express my opinions is by writing.</b></blockquote>
