<b><u>Final Term Paper</u></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flintknapping is the most common and
widespread name for the age-old craft of making</b>
<br><b>stone tools.&nbsp; Not just making a stone tool, however it is better
said to flake a stone tool.&nbsp; Most</b>
<br><b>knappers of the present learn this process through hands on experience
and gaining the knowledge</b>
<br><b>and understanding of why and how stones break or flake.&nbsp; However,
Paleolithic hunters and</b>
<br><b>gathers knew nothing of shock waves or measuring the angles of the
platform in which the stone</b>
<br><b>would flake.&nbsp; It was strictly based on skillful eyes and hands
that could judge what would work</b>
<br><b>and what would fail.&nbsp; For the knappers of our time it is better
to have the comprehension of the</b>
<br><b>basic principles and terminology in order to know why the techniques
work or don’t work.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>other words, what stones are best for flaking, what are the best
angles in which to properly strike,</b>
<br><b>and how much force should be used to get the desired flake.&nbsp;
All of these must be considered</b>
<br><b>before this process can begin.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the early 1800s this process
was used tremendously among the British for making</b>
<br><b>gunflints by breaking long flakes into short pieces.&nbsp; This
was also perceived at the time were</b>
<br><b>archaeology was just developing into a science and stone tools were
starting to be recognized as</b>
<br><b>ancient artifacts of prehistoric humans. It seems that the ways
in which prehistorians vs. modern</b>
<br><b>day flintnappers went about flaking their stone tools, using there
own techniques, and producing</b>
<br><b>the same types of flakes is learned through experience.&nbsp; However
it is said that a basic</b>
<br><b>understanding of the tools as well as the process is necessary to
utilize the concept of this ancient</b>
<br><b>craft.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One necessity for a flintknapper is that
the stone have one basic quality, it has to fracture</b>
<br><b>conchidly in order for the stone not to crack and create other flaws.&nbsp;
To fracture conchidly means</b>
<br><b>that the fracture surfaces are curved like a cockle shell.&nbsp;
By changing the shape and varying the</b>
<br><b>angles and force used on the stone, the fracture can be controlled
and manipulated to the</b>
<br><b>flintknappes disirer.&nbsp; Stones that will fracture conchidly
are thus desirable for flaking and share</b>
<br><b>similar qualities.&nbsp; The stone has to be brittle and homogeneous,
which means that the stone is the</b>
<br><b>same throughout its shape lacking impurities in texture, planes,
cracks, and flaws.&nbsp; Stones that do</b>
<br><b>not fit this description will not fracture conchidly but will ultimately
crack or break when force is</b>
<br><b>applied.&nbsp; The most homogenous stone available is manmade glass
or natural volcanic glasses such</b>
<br><b>as obsidian.&nbsp; To be brittle means that the rock can be easily
broken and not manipulated</b>
<br><b>extensively without causing it to break.&nbsp; Therefore the stone
must be brittle in order for it to be</b>
<br><b>flaked and used.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To accurately be productive as a flintknapper
there are several key concepts that need to</b>
<br><b>be understood.&nbsp; Cores, which is the piece on the rock in which
you strike, and flakes, which are</b>
<br><b>the pieces which come off after pressure and force have been administered.&nbsp;
The fracture surface</b>
<br><b>of the flake contains certain features such as the ventral and the
dorsal surfaces.&nbsp; The ventral</b>
<br><b>meaning belly, and the dorsal meaning back.&nbsp; The surface at
the top of the flake were the initial</b>
<br><b>blow occurred is called the platform.&nbsp; This is also the proximal
end while the opposite is the distal</b>
<br><b>end.&nbsp; If the stone was hit by a hard hammer stone there would
likely be a small crushed area called</b>
<br><b>the point of percussion, most likely on the platform.&nbsp; Ring
cracks, which are small round cracks,</b>
<br><b>may also appear on the top of the cone.&nbsp; Just below the interior
fracture surface of the flake</b>
<br><b>swelling will appear while further down ripples, which are the center
of the point of percussion,</b>
<br><b>will also appear.&nbsp; The force applied to the rock sends waves
through its interior which creates</b>
<br><b>these ripples and flakes.&nbsp; You can also determine which direction
the flake was removed by</b>
<br><b>inspecting the flake scares, which are curved lines were the flake
originally was formed to the</b>
<br><b>rock.&nbsp; Radial fissures are also commonly seen on the interior
surfaces of flakes.&nbsp; These fissures are</b>
<br><b>tiny cracks that are pointed back towards the point were the stone
was struck.&nbsp; Parasitic flake</b>
<br><b>scares are also left behind and can be seen when a small leaf shaped
flake is removed when the</b>
<br><b>stone is struck.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these features of the interior
surface of the flake leave behind a negative indentation</b>
<br><b>on the core.&nbsp; There are numerous variations to the size and
shape to these features that allow a</b>
<br><b>person to accurately assume allot about how the flake was originally
made.&nbsp; The exterior surface</b>
<br><b>tends to show different scars of other flakes.&nbsp; Some flakes
exterior surface may be covered with</b>
<br><b>cortex, which means it is covered by a rough weathered piece of
some other substance.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>occupancy of cortex indicates that the flake was the first struck
from the core.&nbsp; Besides man made</b>
<br><b>flakes, natural forces also produce similar flakes that are hard
to tell apart.&nbsp; However, you can</b>
<br><b>usually tell them apart by noticing patterns.&nbsp; Natural flakes
tend to be random, while man made</b>
<br><b>flakes are patterned.&nbsp; In archaeological digs misinterpreting
a natural flake for a man made flake is</b>
<br><b>rare due to the number of hand axes, arrow heads, and other projectile
points.&nbsp; Although some of</b>
<br><b>the earliest stone tools discovered are so crude that it would be
easily mistaken for natural.</b>
<br><b>Another important factor to the knapper is flake termination’s,
which refers to the distal</b>
<br><b>end of a flake in which there are four main types.&nbsp; The most
common and desirable in the Feather</b>
<br><b>termination’s, were the flake is removed from the core so smoothly
that it produces a sharp</b>
<br><b>feathered edge.&nbsp; Hinge termination forms a rounded edge on
the end of the flake when the</b>
<br><b>fracture surface is turned upward.&nbsp; The step fracture ultimately
destroys the flake and the original</b>
<br><b>force and crack may continue through the core.&nbsp; An overshoot
means the crack continues to the</b>
<br><b>end of the core and removes part of its end by bending downward.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to create these types of flakes
along with others is by using a hard-hammer</b>
<br><b>method, by striking one rock with another.&nbsp; This is a very
basic principle of knapping and requires</b>
<br><b>large pieces of material for best results.&nbsp; The hammer which
is used should be lighter than the core</b>
<br><b>it is striking, because the size of the hammer will affect the size
of the flakes produced.&nbsp; Since</b>
<br><b>hammer stones will also break it is best to have several handy.&nbsp;
The best type of hammer stones</b>
<br><b>are stream rounded pebbles that are less brittle and will not likely
shatter when being struck</b>
<br><b>against another rock.&nbsp; Stones such as chert and obsidian will
not make good hammer stones</b>
<br><b>because with each use the surface of the rock is reduced to an irregular
surface.&nbsp; Rocks that</b>
<br><b>contain cracks or flaws should not be used.&nbsp; Different knappers
use different stones depending on</b>
<br><b>their preference, however, the main point is that there should be
a noticeable spot or point on the</b>
<br><b>hamerstone in which to strike.&nbsp; Over time hammerstones acquire
wear patterns that can be easily</b>
<br><b>depicted.&nbsp; If used frequently the stone will also develop polished
grips were your fingers are</b>
<br><b>usually placed.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of knapping is really
quit simple.&nbsp; A good knapper can easily control the force</b>
<br><b>of the blow being applied, the direction, the point of impact, the
shape he/she wants of the core,</b>
<br><b>and the angles of edges.&nbsp; With every strike the conditions
of the rock change thus the angles and</b>
<br><b>the pressure being applied must change as well.&nbsp; When you first
start knapping it is hard to</b>
<br><b>determine what you are actually doing.&nbsp; In order to completely
understand how to knapp you</b>
<br><b>must understand how to control the variables which create the flakes.&nbsp;
These variables include</b>
<br><b>platform depth, angle of the blow, exterior platform angle, and
force of the blow.&nbsp; To get a large</b>
<br><b>flake more force must be applied as well as a greater platform depth.&nbsp;
Length is determined by the</b>
<br><b>exterior platform angle as well as the different degrees in which
the rock is struck.&nbsp; The most</b>
<br><b>important thing to remember is the exterior platform angle, the
angle in which you strike the rock,</b>
<br><b>and also the shape of the exterior surface were the flake breaks
from.&nbsp; It is common for beginning</b>
<br><b>knappers to hit straight down on the rock, this crushes the rocks
platform and produces cones</b>
<br><b>that also ruin the platform.&nbsp; To produce useful flakes it is
best to strike the rock at an angle that is</b>
<br><b>less the 90 degrees but greater than 35-45 degrees.&nbsp; To hit
the core at these angles it is best if you</b>
<br><b>steady the rock against your leg allowing only your striking hand
to be in motion.&nbsp; Moving the</b>
<br><b>core forces less accuracy and will probably ruin the angle of the
blow.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key to a successful knapping lies
within the platforms of the rock.&nbsp; It is very important</b>
<br><b>that the knapper understand and notice the platforms before they
strike the stone.&nbsp; The platform</b>
<br><b>surface should be clean, free of ridges, soft cortex, or any flaws
or irregularities.&nbsp; A bad platform</b>
<br><b>can usually be saved if it is less than 90 degrees by detaching
another flake and using the face of</b>
<br><b>the other edge as a platform.&nbsp; This will save your platform
and make your stone bifacial in the</b>
<br><b>process.&nbsp; One of the easiest things to control is the exterior
platform angle by facetting, trimming,</b>
<br><b>and rubbing.&nbsp; Facetting removes flakes from the platform surface
which is a useful way to remove</b>
<br><b>irregularities.&nbsp; This process also changes and increases the
exterior platform angle which in turn</b>
<br><b>increases the length of the flake.&nbsp; Trimming removes all small
flakes from the exterior surface of</b>
<br><b>the core which can change the platform angle.&nbsp; This process
is useful because it removes platform</b>
<br><b>edges and reduces the change of crushing the platform.&nbsp; Rubbing
is done with the hamerstone by</b>
<br><b>rubbing it across the edge of the platform.&nbsp; This also removes
thin edges and overhangs that could</b>
<br><b>damage the effects of the flakes.&nbsp; Rubbing also dulls sharp
edges of the platform and allows it</b>
<br><b>easier to produce flakes.&nbsp; All of these techniques help stabilize
the platform which makes it easier</b>
<br><b>for the knapper.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressure flaking is another technique
used by knappers which uses pressure to remove</b>
<br><b>portions of the stone.&nbsp; This technique is used with a flaker,
or a deer antler, and instead of hitting</b>
<br><b>the stone you simply press the antler against the core causing small
pieces to break as a result of</b>
<br><b>added pressure.&nbsp; The platform used for this technique is not
a flat surface but a ridge.&nbsp; The angle</b>
<br><b>used is still less than 90 degrees, however, the angle is formed
against the edge itself and is</b>
<br><b>applied almost parallel to the centerplane.&nbsp; The ideal platform
is just above the face in which you</b>
<br><b>intend to remove a flake and slightly below the other.&nbsp; A bifacial
edge is also ideal but takes more</b>
<br><b>time to construct.&nbsp; A helpful technique within this method
is called shearing, which involves</b>
<br><b>crushing flakes off the edge with the side of the antler.&nbsp;
Another technique called buffering, uses</b>
<br><b>the flaker in one direction away from the face were you are flaking
to pull of different flakes.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>is also a way of dulling the edges of the core.&nbsp; Pressure flaking
is also a good way to create</b>
<br><b>notches in your flakes, such as in projectile points.&nbsp; This
is done by repeatedly removing edges</b>
<br><b>from both sides of the face which creates deep and narrow notches.&nbsp;
The tip of the antler or flaker</b>
<br><b>is the most commonly used for this type of technique.&nbsp; In order
to create an ideal notch downward</b>
<br><b>pressure should be administered and the platform should be at the
centerplane.&nbsp; Small broad flakes</b>
<br><b>will be removed when this technique is used properly.&nbsp; To sum
up the pressure flaking technique</b>
<br><b>one should remember a few essential methods.&nbsp; The pressure
is applied to the edge of the piece,</b>
<br><b>which is the platform, and should be of an angle less than 90 degrees.&nbsp;
The flaker should be placed</b>
<br><b>on the edge with force applied in the direction the flake is to
be removed.&nbsp; Edges should be dull</b>
<br><b>enough to crush and biface all thick edges and right angles.&nbsp;
The last thing to remember is that the</b>
<br><b>platform should be below the centerplane of the piece you are working
with.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn the art of knapping is to
share the same techniques used by the earliest of man.&nbsp; This is</b>
<br><b>most likely the oldest form of weaponry and craftsmanship that has
been discovered.&nbsp; However,</b>
<br><b>the needs of hunter gather groups greatly surpasses our needs for
these types of stone tools.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>were aware of the useful techniques as well as the faulty ones that
created these useful tools but</b>
<br><b>only from a succeed or fail method.&nbsp; They had no concept of
angles or platforms, only the concept</b>
<br><b>of survival was present.&nbsp; Present day knappers have a great
advantage over their ancestors.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>have the knowledge of knowing the precise angles and needed pressure
as well as the terminally</b>
<br><b>to make the exact flake or notch.&nbsp; However the only true way
to explore these methods is by</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; Like every other craft this too must take practice
and patience before it is mastered.</b>
<br><b>Although it is extremely helpful to know exactly why and how flakes
break of different stones</b>
<br><b>when force is applied.&nbsp; It is also necessary to know what stones
are most likely to produce a more</b>
<br><b>suitable flake.&nbsp; The best way to learn how to make stone tools
is not just simply doing your</b>
<br><b>homework on platforms, angles, bifaces, notches, flakes, shock waves
etc., but rather experience.</b></blockquote>
