Notes</font></u></center>

<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 27AUG99: Map Review I</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>The science of archaeology is quite dependent upon maps,
not only to get the archaeologists and their crews in and out of wilderness
areas in which known sites may be located, but also to find similar sites
that may have been discovered and then lost again. In order to find one's
location in respect to a particular site, or even simply a location in
general, one must take bearings using a compass and a sextant (or an instrument
which combines the two). These readings provide the observer with information
as to their exact location in terms of degrees and minutes and seconds
within those degrees-- declination, so to speak. These are useless without
first having taken bearings on known terrain features, as well as heights
of those features. If one has a map, one can compare these terrain features
with the map in order to find one's location on the map. If one does not
have a map, one can at least figure out one's location and begin making
progress in a specific direction; most likely along the same path that
was used in the first place.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 01SEP99: Map Review II</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>Sampling is an important part of archaeology, due to the
fact that there is a massive amount of space to dig through. In order to
break up the data into manageable chunks and to get an "average" overall
picture, the map must be divided into a grid, and sectors of the grid surveyed.
There are a few possibilities for surveying: random selection, stratified
selection and transecting. Random is that: at random. Stratified selection
is choosing grid-squares based on an educated guess. Transecting is choosing
a straight path of grid-squares, either vertical or horizontal, from edge
to edge of the map.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 03SEP99: Video Review</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>Although I knew something about the mounds of the Ohio
&amp; Illinois River valleys, I didn't realize they had been such a center
of debate. The video brought up a good point- that scientific theories,
specifically those of archaeology, are subject to social themes. Often
times, there is pressure upon scientists to conform to the social norm.
For example, it was necessary for Morton to alter the interpretation of
his findings in the craniometry of moundbuilder skulls, when compared with
modern Native skulls (which incidentally, were nearly identical) by creating
a theory of two different people: a white race ruling the red race. This
fabrication was in order to maintain the social belief in the superiority
of the white man. Although the film covered a great deal of information
about the current beliefs and stories surrounding the moundbuilders, nobody
can actually know for sure, and the piecing-together of the past is subject
to whatever social currents exist during the investigation.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 07SEP99: Material Culture I</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>If the dig-site at San Juan Bautista has discovered items
such as a chert core, a trade bead and a bovine tooth, one can determine
from such evidence that it was once a site upon which lived the aboriginal
Americans. This is a conclusion easily reached, because although the Spaniards
lived nearby, their technology had already progressed into metallurgy,
and thus would have little use for stone tools. Secondly, glass beads would
be of little use to the Spaniards because once again, their technology
was advanced enough that they could produce glass windowpanes and other
such items; there would be little or no interest in small coloured glass
beads. The last item, the bovine tooth, provides no information on its
own because it could have been leavings from either the Spanish or the
aboriginal Americans, due to the fact that both raised, slaughtered and
ate bovines. However, in conjunction with all the other items, it helps
strengthen the conjecture that this was an aboriginal American site-- the
tooth may have been part of a tool or a decoration.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 09SEP99: Material Culture II</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>Discussed here is panel #11 from Codex Vindobonensis.
These panels seem to represent agricultural events in relation to the cities
of the Aztec. First it would appear an individual is buried in a tomb-like
structure, and next to that is another individual who appears to be crouching
in rows of maize. Below these images are images of what appear to be priests,
due to their elaborate dress. Along with them are representations of the
toothed, smiling axe-heads, along with other specific glyphs, which may
be part of a name. These individuals seem to be involved in some sort of
sacrifice activity. The next series of pictures seem to be a large panel--
of a city with people in the center row planting seeds. This gives an idea
that the Aztecs were agrarians who sacrificed people in order to make their
crops grow better.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 14SEP99: Material Culture III</font></u>
<p><font size=+1><i>Artifact 2.09:</i> This artifact is approximately one
inch in length and appears to be made of chert, rather than obsidian, due
to its opacity and colour. It is approximately 2 oz. in weight. The material
is striated; an earthy red colour at the bottom with stripes of translucent
cream. The redness gets more orange and slightly more translucent as the
artifact comes to a point; however, whether this is due to the flintknapping
procedure or the material itself is not known. The artifact is not symmetrical;
the flaked side is convex, while the unworked side is concave. There do
not appear to be fasteners on the bottom of this artifact, although there
is a large chip on one side just before the blade begins to taper upward.
This may serve as a fastening point, but as the chip is not reproduced
on the opposite side, it may have merely been a mistake in the flintknapping,
or perhaps may have been caused by damage to the artifact. The texture
of the artifact is quite smooth; there does not look like there was very
many strikes made along the main body, whereas the tip was worked slightly
more. It would appear that this is a failed or unfinished attempt at making
an arrowhead.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Artifact 4.14: </i>This artifact is the same size as
artifact 2.09 and is more refined than its predecessor. It weighs less
than 1 oz. and does not appear to be made of obsidian. Chalcedony or chert,
perhaps, due to its waxy lustre. It is a creamy brown in colour and translucent
along the cutting edges, from the fine quality of the stoneworking involved.
Below the head is a flange for fastening to an arrow-shaft. The fastening-points
are tiny (less than 1/8 inch) and one side is so well-constructed that
it is nearly perfectly circular. The object is almost completely symmetrical
on each face, with the exception of one of the fastening point flanges--
it appears to have sustained damage. The object is clearly a small projectile-point;
possibly an arrow-head.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Artifact 4.22:</i> This artifact, again identified
as chalcedony from its waxy lustre,</font>
<p><font size=+1>is a little under three inches in length. It is a creamy
grey-brown with striations of lighter cream running diagonally through
it. The artifact is leaf-shaped and symmetrically sharpened, but it is
not symmetrical on its faces. There is a large concavity in one side, possibly
from a mistake made in the flintknapping procedure. This object appears
to be a generic point, for either a spear or a bone or antler-handled knife.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 22SEP99: Chichen</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>The construction of Chichen Itza began roughly around
650 A.D. and was inhabited up until around 1250 A.D. Classic Maya people
inabited for a while. Afterward, the Itza people, who immigrated to the
site around 800 A.D, inhabited it. At this time, the city underwent serious
change. Professors at Harvard interpreted (from this site) that the Maya,
whom they believed to be chiefly peasants ruled by a priest-astronomer
elite, were thought to be the only people inhabiting these specific sites.
These scholars believed that the Maya used these sites almost like universities.
According to the Harvard Scholars, the Maya cities weren't cities at all,
but massive ceremonial centers dominated by enormous temples. This theory
was based on the swidden (slash-and-burn) agricultural method, which again,
according to the Harvard Scholars, easily explained the rise and fall of
Maya civilization. Included with this theory, swidden agriculture allowed
priest-kings to become powerful due to the fact that the soil could go
sterile at any time and because of this, their people were fatalistic.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Other problems arose from people like Augustus lePlongeon,
who believed that the lost Tribes of Israel created Mayan cities. lePlongeon
discovered a figure which he named "Chac Mool" (meaning Red Jaguar in the
Maya tongue). He fabricated the history of Maya culture from his discovery
of this artifact and other misidentified statuary, and he felt that there
was a lost continent, one that had slid under the ocean due to the Maya
forsaking their gods, which he named "Lemuria". This was the only solution
he could come up with, due to his lack of faith in the abilities of the
indigenous people to create a civilization. Soon thereafter, lePlongeon
tried to make off with some Chac Mool statues, but the indigenous Maya
resisted his efforts. Despite them, he was able to take some away, damaging
the site of the Temple of the Warriors.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Four periods of archaeological inquiry into the Americas</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Speculative Period, 1400-1840</i>: Europeans developing
curiosity in the peoples west of the Gibraltar; encounters and conflicts
with native Americans; European speculations as to the nature of the people
of the Americas because of their conflicts.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Descriptive Period</i>, <i>1840-1910</i>: Attempts
to discern a picture that could describe the peoples of the Americas, north,
central and south. Studies were done of of "elite" civilizations. Excavations
done specifically on elite burials, palaces, temples, etc.; much disbelief
in the civilization-building ability of the peoples that the Europeans
conquered.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Historical Period, 1910-1940</i>: Preoccupation with
building chronologies of the histories of the peoples of Americas. Migration
theories, maintenance of the status quo belief in the inability of indigenous
peoples to have a "civilized" culture.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Explanatory Period, 1940-Present</i>: Germans running
around the world, collecting relics in order to establish a 1,000-year
reich. German archaeologists collected spiritual and occult artifacts in
order to help bring power to Adolf Hitler. Soldiers were trained and educated,
and during the post-war boom, many went on to get college degrees, making
a profound impact on the previous generations of scholars. This was due
to the fact that previously, most scholars were of the elite class, whereas
soldiers were of lower classes. Many of these new recruits began to transform
and question human society on a level that had never been seen before and
began to excavate other sites, stuff like village life, platform mounds,
homes of the common people. Questions and explanations, complete explorations.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Chichen was a trade center of Mesoamerica, and trade links
have been found in up into Texas and Louisiana, and down into Columbia
and South America. Murals in Chichen Itza show mixed races living in harmony.
Old Chichen was built from 650-800 A.D., and was believed to have been
undergone siege and invasion by the Itza. The Aztec site of Tula Hidaldo
has been compared to Chichen Itza. Limestone sinkwells were the source
of fresh water for cities of the Maya. Some wells were used as sites of
sacrifice, for offerings to the gods.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The plumed serpent, Quetzalcoatl, was a symbol of the
planet Venus and its twin, the Earth. According to Mayan myth, the Sun
came out of Itzamna (the Milky Way) and was swallowed by the jaws of the
Earth Lord. These were themes throughout Mesoamerica, as was the theme
of human heart excision as a form of sacrifice. lePlongeon's Chac Mool
figures are now believed to be receptacles for post-sacrifice human hearts,
and the figure itself is seen as a fallen warrior, having done battle with
jaguars, rain gods, etc. The Maya built massive roads, big enough to drive
a Mack truck upon, and high enough to avoid flooding by jungle rains. As
a road led out of a city, massive archways were constructed as a beginning
and an end of the road. They constructed their cities drawing on civilizations
from which they were influenced, and by virtue of their roads, their culture
influenced others.</font>

<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 29SEP99: Flintknapping Video Review</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>The interesting thing about stone tools is that all of
them are made from a type of brittle, yet flexible stone that breaks and
flakes in a predictable manner. Despite this limitation, there are several
types of stone that fit this agenda, chief among them obsidian, but also
jasper, agate, chalcedony and chert. All these sorts of stone have the
same qualities: they are elastic, in the sense that they will not shatter
upon striking, yet are brittle enough to produce edges, and contain no
internal fracture planes, thus allowing the flintknapper to decide where
things needed to be struck off.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In order to begin flintknapping, one needs to begin with
a large hunk of one of the aforementioned rocks, called a core. The core
in and of itself is relatively unusable as a tool, but it is handy in that
it can be the source of many smaller flakes which can used as tools in
their own right. Because the core has no internal fracture planes, the
flintknapper decides upon which angle he or she wishes to strike with a
hammerstone. Because the force is transmitted through the rock in a conical
pattern, flakes come off in relation to that pattern. Thus, the angle at
which a blow is struck in relation to a ridge on the core will dictate
the shape of the flake struck off by the blow.</font>
<p><font size=+1>When a flintknapper strikes off a large flake, it can
be used as a variety of tools. Upon being struck off, it has an amazingly
sharp edge, but one that dulls very quickly. A tool like this could be
used for skinning. After the sharp edge has been dulled, the tool can be
reworked into something different, something more durable, with a serrated
edge. Flakes are struck off in small numbers to create this serrated edge
in accordance with the physics of the stone being used. Such a tool can
be used for butchering. After this, the tool can be reworked again into
something thinner and flatter, something which can be used to cut meat
into thin strips, for drying. After this use, a portion of the tool can
be reworked yet again to be used as a scraper. The flintknapper knocks
off long, flat sections of rock to produce an edge similar to that of the
first iteration of the tool. Finally, after all these uses, the tool can
be reworked into a spearpoint, by thinning, flattening and sharpening the
edges through a variety of processes; including percussion, indirect percussion
and pressure flaking. Pressure flaking becomes more important as the tool
gets thinner, because too strong of a force could break or shatter the
tool. Pressure flaking is not done by a hammerstone, but rather by antler
or strong bone, a softer material which knocks off smaller, more controlled
flakes.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 06OCT99: Lab Deliverable IV, Stone Tools
I</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>The process of learning flintknapping is valuable to archaeologists
because it allows them to experience the process firsthand, and thus understand
how artifacts were constructed. Through experimenting with the materials
and processes integral to stone tool production, archaeologists can gain
knowledge of the processes that go into the artifacts they discover, and
thus better classify that which they discover; i.e., hard- and soft-hammer
percussion, indirect percussion and pressure-flaking.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Hard-Hammer Percussion</i>: The process by which the
nodule or flake of material is worked by hitting it directly with a hard
stone hammer. Used when a flintknapper wanted to break off large chunks
of the material before working them.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Soft-Hammer Percussion:</i> The process by which the
flake of material is worked by hitting it directly with a soft hammer made
of bone, antler or wood. Used when a flintknapper needed to work the flake
with more sophistication and less force.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Indirect Percussion:</i> The process by which the flake
of material is worked by hitting the soft hammer with another soft hammer
or hammerstone, which in turn transfers force into the material. Much like
the previous, this process was used when the flintknapper needed to work
the flake with greater sophistication than even the previous could offer.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Pressure-Flaking:</i> The process by which the flake
of material is chipped and flaked by use of a small, soft implement, like
an antler tip. This was used when a flintknapper needed to work an edge
into a serrated blade, resharpen an edge or even chip off large bits of
the material from flat surfaces of the flake. During the lab on TH30SEP99,
all but indirect percussion was used to work obsidian nodules into stone
tools.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 03NOV99: Restoration</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>If I were responsible for art restoration in a historical
site, I would still wish to restore the art to its original iteration,
especially if other parts of the area were being restored to its original
state. For example, the roof of the Sistine Chapel was coated with soot
and at some point after its original painting, conveniently-placed "modesty"
cloths were painted over the private parts of the people in the paintings.
The Sistine Chapel was cleaned and restored to its original state, as I
believe places like San Juan Bautista should be cleaned and restored to
its original state. If something is an historic item, and one is trying
to represent something as it was in a specific period of history, even
if it is a palimpsest or was very gaudy, it should be returned to its original
iteration, because that's how it was meant to be seen by the original artists.</font>
<p><u><font size=+1>Journal Entry, 10NOV99: Virtual Dig</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>In submitting grant proposals for an archaeological project,
one has to take into account quite a few things before even picking up
a shovel. For example, one needs to realize that costs of food and housing
(or camping, as the case may be) begin to take up quite a bit of the budget,
as the population of the site grows larger. Equipment and travel expenses
are also quite a bit of the costs, but what takes up most of all are the
salaries of the people employed. Naturally, one cannot expect people to
work for free!</font>
