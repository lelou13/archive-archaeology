<p><font size=+2><u>Garbological Analysis and Conclusions Regarding Subject
O</u>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Collection and quantification of Subject O.’s garbage
began on December 3 and ended December 6. At first, Subject O. surrendered
his garbage without hesitation, but once finding out it was being used
to study his behavior, he began to filter his garbage before giving it
to me. Thus, there are only one to two days’ worth of honest data. He submitted
the garbage from both December 5 and 6 combined in one bag; thus, there
are only three days’ worth of collection quantification listed.</font>
<p><font size=+1>After analyzing the leavings of Subject O., it is possible
to reach some strong conclusions about his behaviors and his environment.
Foremost, there was no evidence of any kind relating to the consumption
of any fruits or vegetables, fresh, frozen or otherwise. The only food-items
found were either pre-packaged or canned, some specifically excluding vegetable
material (i.e., chili without beans), with the sole exclusion being that
of apple juice. Thus, it can be hypothesized that Subject O. does not consider
fruits or vegetables to be part of his diet, except in juice-form.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The continuation of the analysis revealed that in addition
to his canned food, Subject O. eats a great deal of starchy foods, through
cheese-flavored and rice-flavored crackers. This can be determined from
the discovery of several large-capacity containers of these items. Apparently,
he especially prefers the cheese-flavored, due to the discovery of the
3 lb. container with accompanying bags. He also appears to enjoy sweet
foods: his consumption of soft-drinks, specifically Pepsi-Cola, is extremely
high (eleven containers appeared in a <i>single</i> analysis), while evidence
of chewing gum and gum wrappers occurred in every analysis.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This individual would seem to be the owner of both a PC
and a platform game console, due to the discovery of the packaging of multiple
accessories. On the second collection analysis, there were a pair of two-pack
ink-cartridge containers for a high-end computer printer. On the third
analysis, the cellophane from a Sony Playstation game was found, along
with the packaging of a game-controller and several discarded recordable
CDs. Mail, coupons and newspapers (specifically: <i>PC Paper</i>) relating
to software and computer items confirmed this conjecture.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Despite his eating habits, Subject O. is apparently quite
concerned with personal hygiene. On every occasion of analysis, evidence
of this was made apparent, especially on the second and third analyses,
with a travel toiletry kit, two packages of floss and the discarding of
an ordinary travel toothbrush in favor of a high-end consumer toothbrush.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Subject O. may have been raised in an environment where
neither food nor money are scarce, as he discards with great profligacy
and never recycles, neither is he picky about completely finishing his
meals.&nbsp; Cans of chili and ravioli invariably had enough residue for
a few spoonfuls more, discarded bags of crackers were never completely
empty, pizza pieces left half-eaten, etc. Indeed, plastic utensils appeared
in every single can, most fastened tightly to the bottom in congealed sauce.
Other items were discarded even before use; an unused travel toothbrush,
for example. Finally, all three of the collection analyses showed evidence
of shopping having occurred, with expenditures between $60.00 and $150.00;
discovery of receipts and price tags confirmed this.</font>
<p><font size=+1>On a final note, discovery of notes about ancient Japanese
weaponry and the package of imported Japanese rice crackers would seem
to suggest Subject O. to be either of Japanese descent, or to have an interest
in Japanese culture.</font>

<p><font size=+1>I chose to categorize the data into several sub-groups,
as is shown by the table above.&nbsp; I thought that perhaps the best option
would be to compare non food-related items (i.e., CDs, video game materials,
etc.) versus food and other food-related&nbsp; items in order to show exactly
how much of the garbage made up diet.&nbsp; Secondly, I thought recyclables
could give clues as to his economic status (as mentioned in the project
proposal), especially because a vast amount of Subject O.'s leavings could
have been recycled.&nbsp; Finally, I thought perhaps an overall picture
would be useful for purposes of comparison.</font>
<p><font size=+1>On the subject of the experimental archaeological tactic,
<i>garbology</i>,
it would seem to be a useful tool in determining the habits, attitudes
and interests of a person or group of people. The amount of evidence discovered
from the leavings of Subject O. does exactly that: it allows the investigator
to come up with good hypotheses and assumptions relating to his nature.
However, it is important, as with any scientific endeavour, that the data
be quantified carefully. Careless grouping or exclusion of data can quickly
skew the resulting picture.</font>
