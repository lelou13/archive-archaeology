<p><font size=+1>After taking into consideration the past semester, I think
that I have done fairly well in this class. Although I may not have attended
every session, I feel have learned the essence of the archaeological process;
the science behind the shovels, so to speak. I’ve learned the ability to
apply a logical method to my work. I’ve learned to be an observer and a
surveyor. I’ve picked through trash, I’ve counted rocks, I’ve spent hours
upon hours quantifying data—hell, I’ve even managed to learn how to bash
a couple of sticks and rocks together and come out with a useable tool.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>I’ve come to understand archaeology as being the science
of creating something from nothing. Almost magically, an archaeologist
can take into the laboratory a few layers of soil, measurements of scattered
rocks, collections of potsherds and then tell you all about the people
who lived on a particular squat of land thousands of years ago. The effect
is humbling, because the trappings of a material culture—and humans have
maintained a material culture ever since they started lugging sticks and
rocks around—can tell someone all about you, even long after you’ve been
dead. The magic is science; a prestidigitation of rocks and flakes, tables
and charts, graphs and data into a feasible theory of human history. Indeed,
there is a sense of magic as the last piece of evidence falls into place.
After I’d spent hours collecting and quantifying garbage, the last few
little things came together to provide a crystal-clear picture of the behaviors
of the fellow I was studying.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>After all the bloodied knuckles, gashed fingers, obsidian
splinters, garbage swill and bloodshot eyes, what can be said? Archaeology
is indeed a science, but a down-home, get-your-hands-dirty science. Yet,
in all its muddiness, both literal and conjectural, there is an elegance.
I can state from personal experience that one man’s trash truly <i>is </i>another
man’s treasure—especially if that man is an archaeologist. Sweep away the
dirt and you find history. Move aside the clods of debris and you will
find civilization. It is to science what taking high tea out of a pewter
coffee-mug is to fine dining. It may not be pretty, but it gets the job
done.</font></center>
