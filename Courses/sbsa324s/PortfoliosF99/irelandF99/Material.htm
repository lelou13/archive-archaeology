<p><font size=+1>In this exercise, the students were given three stone
tools, to analyze, describe and possibly identify the nature thereof. The
motive behind this was to gain an understanding of <i>material culture</i>,
or the items and artifices that make up a society. The understanding of
material culture is crucial to archaeology, as it is through the study
of material cultures of peoples past that leads to knowledge about our
ancestors. Ancient people left no records, just the pieces and artifacts
that made up their daily lives.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Artifact 2.09:</i> This artifact is approximately one
inch in length and appears to be made of chert, rather than obsidian, due
to its opacity and color. It is approximately 2 oz. in weight. The material
is striated; an earthy red color at the bottom with stripes of translucent
cream. The redness gets more orange and slightly more translucent as the
artifact comes to a point; however, whether this is due to the flintknapping
procedure or the material itself is not known. The artifact is not symmetrical;
the flaked side is convex, while the unworked side is concave. There do
not appear to be fasteners on the bottom of this artifact, although there
is a large chip on one side just before the blade begins to taper upward.
This may serve as a fastening point, but as the chip is not reproduced
on the opposite side, it may have merely been a mistake in the flintknapping,
or perhaps may have been caused by damage to the artifact. The texture
of the artifact is quite smooth; there does not look like there was very
many strikes made along the main body, whereas the tip was worked slightly
more. It would appear that this is a failed or unfinished attempt at making
an arrowhead.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Artifact 4.14: </i>This artifact is the same size as
artifact 2.09 and is more refined than its predecessor. It weighs less
than 1 oz. and does not appear to be made of obsidian. Chalcedony or chert,
perhaps, due to its waxy luster. It is a creamy brown in colour and translucent
along the cutting edges, from the fine quality of the stoneworking involved.
Below the head is a flange for fastening to an arrow-shaft. The fastening-points
are tiny (less than 1/8 inch) and one side is so well-constructed that
it is nearly perfectly circular. The object is almost completely symmetrical
on each face, with the exception of one of the fastening point flanges--
it appears to have sustained damage. The object is clearly a small projectile-point;
possibly an arrow-head.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Artifact 4.22:</i> This artifact, again identified
as chalcedony from its waxy luster, is a little under three inches in length.
It is a creamy grey-brown with striations of lighter cream running diagonally
through it. The artifact is leaf-shaped and symmetrically sharpened, but
it is not symmetrical on its faces. There is a large concavity in one side,
possibly from a mistake made in the flintknapping procedure. This object
appears to be a generic point, for either a spear or a bone or antler-handled
knife.</font>
