<p><font size=+1>There has long been a debate between historians and archaeologists.
Historians gain an understanding of the past through the collection, copy,
translation and analysis of written records. Archaeologists, on the other
hand, study the past by surveying an area directly and studying the leavings
of their material culture left in and on the soil, in an attempt to piece
together a behavioral picture of the people. Historians claim there is
little place for archaeology in a historical venue, as its results are
mostly theory and conjecture; written records are concrete evidence. Unfortunately,
few human cultures actually developed writing, thus only a small percentage
of human history has been written down. Furthermore, due to the work of
the elements, even fewer written records have survived to the present.
This leaves the historian floundering while the archaeologist steps into
the limelight. Yet the question still remains: does the study of ancient
leavings tell anything about the people who left them?</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>One way to find out whether archaeology is useful is to
study modern trash to see if it provides clues as to the lifestyle of a
person or group of people. This process is called <i>experimental archaeology</i>;
specifically in this case, <i>garbology</i>. Determination of this is not
just from the trash; proper questions need to be answered in order to determine
the nature of that person. For example: "What does this person eat, and
how do they eat it?" Diet can tell a lot about a person or people, especially
in today’s society. Food waste and food packaging would be the debitage
of a modern person’s diet. If a person eats a lot of take-out and pre-packaged
food, one could guess that he or she has a fairly stable income, since
those types of food tend to cost more. Conversely, if a person eats a lot
of generic or store-brand foods, supplemented with produce, one might guess
that he or she is on a lesser step of the economic ladder.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Another question might be: "How does this person live?
What kinds of things do they do?" The types of non food-related packaging
materials a person discards can give insight into what types of things
that person collects, maintains or uses. Paper waste can give clues as
to what type of work he or she does, or what kind of student he or she
is. Other miscellaneous items round out the picture.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Finally, other evidence can round out the picture and
perhaps provide clues into questions that may not yet have been asked.
For example, postulations can be made about the person’s economic status
and their attitudes when compared with their recycling waste. If a person
does not recycle, perhaps it is because they are careless, or perhaps they
are too financially well-endowed to worry about recyclable redemption value.
If a person does recycle, perhaps it is because they care about the environment,
or they need the redemption money from such items.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>It is through garbology I plan to prove the feasibility
of archaeology as a historical science. Using the above strategies and
theories, I will collect, quantify and analyze trash from a neighbor. With
the resulting data, I hope to create an accurate picture of that person’s
life, habits and behaviors.</font>
