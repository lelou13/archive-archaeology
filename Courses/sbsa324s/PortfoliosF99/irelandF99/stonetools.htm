Review</font></u></center>

<p><font size=+1>The process of learning flintknapping is valuable to archaeologists
because it allows them to experience the process firsthand, and thus understand
how artifacts were constructed. Through experimenting with the materials
and processes integral to stone tool production, archaeologists can gain
knowledge of the processes that go into the artifacts they discover, and
thus better classify that which they discover; i.e., hard- and soft-hammer
percussion, indirect percussion and pressure-flaking.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The interesting thing about stone tools is that all of
them are made from a type of brittle, yet flexible stone that breaks and
flakes in a predictable manner. Despite this limitation, there are several
types of stone that fit this agenda, chief among them obsidian, but also
jasper, agate, chalcedony and chert. All these sorts of stone have the
same qualities: they are elastic, in the sense that they will not shatter
upon striking, yet are brittle enough to produce edges, and contain no
internal fracture planes, thus allowing the flintknapper to decide where
things needed to be struck off.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>In order to begin flintknapping, one needs to begin with
a large hunk of one of the aforementioned rocks, called a core. The core
in and of itself is relatively unusable as a tool, but it is handy in that
it can be the source of many smaller flakes which can used as</font>
<br><font size=+1>tools in their own right. Because the core has no internal
fracture planes, the flintknapper decides upon which angle he or she wishes
to strike with a hammerstone. Because the force is transmitted through
the rock in a conical pattern, flakes come off in relation to that pattern.
Thus, the angle at which a blow is struck in relation to a ridge on the
core will dictate the shape of the flake struck off by the blow.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>When a flintknapper strikes off a large flake, it can
be used as a variety of tools. Upon being struck off, it has an amazingly
sharp edge, but one that dulls very quickly. A tool like this could be
used for skinning. After the sharp edge has been dulled, the tool can be
reworked into something different, something more durable, with a serrated
edge. Flakes are struck off in small numbers to create this serrated edge
in accordance with the physics of the stone being used. Such a tool can
be used for butchering. After this, the tool can be reworked again into
something thinner and flatter, something which can be used to cut meat
into thin strips, for drying. After this use, a portion of the tool can
be reworked yet again to be used as a scraper. The flintknapper knocks
off long, flat sections of rock toproduce an edge similar to that of the
first iteration of the tool. Finally, after all these uses, the tool can
be reworked into a spearpoint, by thinning, flattening and sharpening the
edges through a variety of processes; including percussion, indirect percussion
and pressure flaking. Pressure flaking becomes more important as the tool
gets thinner, because too strong of a force could break or shatter the
tool. Pressure flaking is not done by a hammerstone, but rather by antler
or strong bone, a softer material which knocks off smaller, more controlled
flakes.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Hard-Hammer Percussion</i>: The process by which the
nodule or flake of material is worked by hitting it directly with a hard
stone hammer. Used when a flintknapper wanted to break off large chunks
of the material before working them.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Soft-Hammer Percussion:</i> The process by which the
flake of material is worked by hitting it directly with a soft hammer made
of bone, antler or wood. Used when a flintknapper needed to work the flake
with more sophistication and less force.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Indirect Percussion:</i> The process by which the flake
of material is worked by hitting the soft hammer with another soft hammer
or hammerstone, which in turn transfers force into the material. Much like
the previous, this process was used when the flintknapper needed to work
the flake with greater sophistication than even the previous could offer.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Pressure-Flaking:</i> The process by which the flake
of material is chipped and flaked by use of a small, soft implement, like
an antler tip. This was used when a flintknapper needed to work an edge
into a serrated blade, resharpen an edge or even chip off large bits of
the material from flat surfaces of the flake.</font>
