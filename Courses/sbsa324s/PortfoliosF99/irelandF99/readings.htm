<p><font size=+1>The construction of Chichen Itza began roughly around
650 A.D. and was inhabited up until around 1250 A.D. Classic Maya people
inabited for a while. Afterward, the Itza people, who immigrated to the
site around 800 A.D, inhabited it. At this time, the city underwent serious
change. Professors at Harvard used this site chiefly in creating an interpretation
that the Maya were chiefly peasants led by a priest-astronomer elite, who
ruled through their predictions of the heavens.&nbsp; Additionally, the
Maya were believed to be the only people inhabiting these specific types
of sites.&nbsp; These scholars believed that the Maya used these sites
almost like universities. According to the Harvard Scholars, the Maya cities
weren't cities at all, but massive ceremonial centers dominated by enormous
temples. This theory was based on the swidden (slash-and-burn) agricultural
method, which again, according to the Harvard Scholars, easily explained
the rise and fall of Maya civilization. Included with this theory, swidden
agriculture allowed priest-kings to become powerful due to the fact that
the soil could go sterile at any time and because of this, their people
were fatalistic.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Other problems of accuracy arose from people like Augustus
lePlongeon, who believed that the lost Tribes of Israel created Mayan cities.
lePlongeon discovered a figure which he named "Chac Mool" (meaning Red
Jaguar in the Maya tongue). He fabricated the history of Maya culture from
his discovery of this artifact and other misidentified statuary, and he
felt that there was a lost continent, one that had slid under the ocean
due to the Maya forsaking their gods, which he named "Lemuria". This was
the only solution he could come up with, due to his lack of faith in the
abilities of the indigenous people to create a civilization. Soon thereafter,
lePlongeon tried to make off with some Chac Mool statues, but the indigenous
Maya resisted his efforts. Despite them, he was able to take some away,
damaging the site of the Temple of the Warriors.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>There were four periods of archaeological inquiry into
the Americas</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Speculative Period, 1400-1840</i>: Europeans developing
curiosity in the peoples west of the Gibraltar; encounters and conflicts
with native Americans; European speculations as to the nature of the people
of the Americas because of their conflicts.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Descriptive Period</i>, <i>1840-1910</i>: Attempts
to discern a picture that could describe the peoples of the Americas, north,
central and south. Studies were done of of "elite" civilizations. Excavations
done specifically on elite burials, palaces, temples, etc.; much disbelief
in the civilization-building ability of the peoples that the Europeans
conquered.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Historical Period, 1910-1940</i>: Preoccupation with
building chronologies of the histories of the peoples of Americas. Migration
theories, maintenance of the status quo belief in the inability of indigenous
peoples to have a "civilized" culture.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Explanatory Period, 1940-Present</i>: Germans running
around the world, collecting relics in order to establish a 1,000-year
reich. German archaeologists collected spiritual and occult artifacts in
order to help bring power to Adolf Hitler. Soldiers were trained and educated,
and during the post-war boom, many went on to get college degrees, making
a profound impact on the previous generations of scholars. This was due
to the fact that previously, most scholars were of the elite class, whereas
soldiers were of lower classes. Many of these new recruits began to transform
and question human society on a level that had never been seen before and
began to excavate other sites, stuff like village life, platform mounds,
homes of the common people. Questions and explanations, complete explorations.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Chichen was a trade center of Mesoamerica, and trade links
have been found in up into Texas and Louisiana, and down into Columbia
and South America. Murals in Chichen Itza show mixed races living in harmony.
Old Chichen was built from 650-800 A.D., and was believed to have been
undergone siege and invasion by the Itza. The Aztec site of Tula Hidaldo
has been compared to Chichen Itza. Limestone sinkwells were the source
of fresh water for cities of the Maya. Some wells were used as sites of
sacrifice, for offerings to the gods.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The plumed serpent, Quetzalcoatl, was a symbol of the
planet Venus and its twin, the Earth. According to Mayan myth, the Sun
came out of Itzamna (the Milky Way) and was swallowed by the jaws of the
Earth Lord. These were themes throughout Mesoamerica, as was the theme
of human heart excision as a form of sacrifice. lePlongeon's Chac Mool
figures are now believed to be receptacles for post-sacrifice human hearts,
and the figure itself is seen as a fallen warrior, having done battle with
jaguars, rain gods, etc. The Maya built massive roads, big enough to drive
a Mack truck upon, and high enough to avoid flooding by jungle rains. As
a road led out of a city, massive archways were constructed as a beginning
and an end of the road. They constructed their cities drawing on civilizations
from which they were influenced, and by virtue of their roads, their culture
influenced others.</font>
