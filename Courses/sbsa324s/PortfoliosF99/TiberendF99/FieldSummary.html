<p><b>Field Work Summary</b>
<p>&nbsp;The field work project that I worked on at San Juan Bautista,
encompassed learning about the archaeological and historical study of the
San Juan Bautista Mission.&nbsp; I was involved in the archaeology program
in the Social and Behavioral Sciences at California State Monterey Bay.&nbsp;
I was a student in Dr. Mendoza's Archaeology: From Map to Museum class,
where I participated in student projects and project -based learning experiences
that currently focus on the development of resources for the historic preservation
and archaeological salvage of the San Juan Bautista Mission.
<p>&nbsp;I choose to work at the mission to meet the service learning requirement
at California State Monterey Bay.&nbsp; I learned about how the field work
is geared towards the excavation, documentation, and restoration of the
archaeological and historical collection so of the mission.
<p>&nbsp;My objective in the class was to learn more about archaeology
and the history behind the Old Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; Under Dr.
Mendoza's guidance, I learned how to apply the methods that were being
taught within the classroom lecture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Working on the archaeology
project at the mission is very hard work and exciting at the same time.
<p>&nbsp;During class-room lectures, the students were introduced to the
methods, principles, and practices of field archaeology by exercises that
explained stress strategy, interpretation, description, information management,
archaeological technologies, and the role of scientific inquiry in the
human sciences.
<p>&nbsp;In addition, I learned how to use different excavation tools to
excavate the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was assigned to excavate in small-sectioned
quarters that were part of the old quadrangle that was consumed by fire
of an unknown origin.&nbsp; I used pick axes, brushes, and dust pans to
remove the dirt so that I could sift through the material, in order to
find artifacts.
<p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I never found any exciting artifacts at the mission,
but I did find some small pieces of black and white transferware ceramic.&nbsp;
The most exciting artifact that I found was a broken cast iron pot that
was probably used to cook within the fire pit.
<p>&nbsp;Overall, my service learning experience is a valuable and educational
experience and I hope to use some of the information I have learned, in
my senior capstone.
