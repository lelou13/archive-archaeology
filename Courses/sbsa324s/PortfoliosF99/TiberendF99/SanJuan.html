<p><font face="Palatino">Today, was my first day at the San Juan Bautista
site. Professor Mendoza gave the Orientation. I excavated in the N10 W38
NW1/4 Quarter, level 1 area. My observations of the site was very interesting.
Presently, the area that is being excavated, is where a former building
stood, before raiding Indians burned it down. I learned how to excavate
with different types of tools. Excavating the site is tedious and dirty
work, but leaning the process was worth the effort. Proper excavating techniques
were introduced to us, and we how to search for artifacts through either
wet or dry methods. First, I dug up enough dirt and material in the quarter,
and then I shifted the dirt with the wet (water) method to look for artifacts.
I found the following artifacts: reddish-brown building materials, stone
tool chert flakes, bottle caps, larger stone tools that were used to grind
food, pottery shards. Another student I had been working with, found some
old Indian beads. I am looking forward to learning more about the History
associated with Archaeology. I have an interest in History.</font>

<br><font face="Palatino">&nbsp;November 12,1999 Today was my last day
for service learning at the mission. I learned a&nbsp; lot working at the
excavation site. I will miss working at the mission. Even though the work&nbsp;
is just a little dirty!! I worked in the N10W38 SE1/4 section. The objective
was 40cm. I&nbsp; was able to start the third level. As I get closer to
40cm. the area will have more&nbsp; interesting artifacts because the area
will be undisturbed. Dr. Mendoza believes this</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">&nbsp;specific site contains the other wall to
the Nunnery building. The artifacts found were:&nbsp; Adobe building material,
white stucco, old rusty wire, rusty nails, siltstone, and small&nbsp; Pieces
of glass. I needed to make the walls in the guadrint straight in order
to prevent the&nbsp; Bathtub problem. The walls need to be shaved off with
an ax, to make them straight. This&nbsp; helps to show the stratigraphy
better. The dirt seems to be easier to remove which helps</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">&nbsp;the excavation move along faster.</font>

<br><font face="Palatino">Today, I went out to San Juan Bautista Mission
for my fourth field work project. The weather was great as usual!! I worked
in the N10W38SE1/4 quarter. John and I worked together to bring the level
down to 40cm. Presently, we are at level two. I found this quarter to be
easier to dig. The dirt wasn't as hard and didn't contain as much adobe.
This site was exciting to work in because I found a lot of interesting
artifacts. I had</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">&nbsp;to use the pick ax more carefully than
before. Because we found large bone and a rusty&nbsp; wire that was embedded
in tile material. I was curious to find out where this wire was leading
to. Finally, I uncovered the rest of the remaining wire, it wasn't attached
any other</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">&nbsp;artifacts. The artifacts I found were:
metal tool, rusty wire, charcoal, stucco, and black transferware (ceramic)
siltsone, and tile fragments. The most exciting artifact I found that day
was the ceramic transferware because the detail was beautiful. The pattern
consisted of small white-brown flowers. Also, I learned more about how
to catalog artifacts insitu within the site. John also found some good
artifacts, such as white opalized glass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fragments.</font>

<br><font face="Palatino">San Juan Bautista Mission: fieldwork today, was
an interesting day! Professor Mendoza wanted us to reach 20cm. in our quarters.
I continued to work in the N10 W38 NW1/4 quarter. At the present time,
I am still in level one. The work was hard and tiring&nbsp; because most
of the people in our class didn't show up to help. My quarter happened
to contain hard glass material; tile material, siltstone, and adobe. The
dirt has dried up which makes the digging difficult. I learned how to use
different types of picks. Next week, Professor Mendoza will wet down the
soil, so that the digging will be easier. Today, I Catalogued the following
artifacts: light-green glass fragments, bone fragments, stucco, and tile</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">&nbsp;fragments, siltsone, and charcoal. I learned
more about how to weigh artifacts. I hope to bring my daughter's eighth
grade class, to tour the mission with Professor Mendoza.:)</font>

<br><font face="Palatino">I haven't been up to the excavation site, for
a couple of weeks. So, I have been looking forward to finish working in
my unit. Professor Mendoza suggested that I continue working in the N10W38SE1/4.
The objective is still 40cm. I worked with John in the unit, we were</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">able to reach the third level. Before we started
to excavate further, we had to dismantle the first and second levels that
we had been digging around because they had been disturbed. At one point,
we were exciting because we thought we had found a human skull or a canon
ball!! However, our hopes we crushed because Professor Mendoza determined
that the artifact was a polished rock with pressure cracks running through
it. I used the dry sifting method instead of the wet method. The artifacts
I found were red building material, white earthenware ceramic fragments,
stucco, and adobe building&nbsp; material. Unfortunately, I didn't find
anything exciting. Although, Professor Mendoza believes we are getting
closer to the building wall, we have been excavating for.</font>

<br><font face="Palatino">Today, September 17,1999, I went to work at San
Juan Bautista which is part of my course work. After my first visit a week
ago, I have become more comfortable and knowledgeable about what I am doing.
Thus far, the excavation at the site, has been very interesting. Yet, the
excavating itself has been slow and tedious. I find myself wanting to dig
faster. so that I can find good artifacts. Last Friday, I excavated in
the same quarter</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">(N10 W38 NW1/4,Level 1) where I continued to
dig to reach 20cm. While I was excavating, I found small ceramic fragments
and some different colored glass fragments, which I wasv very exciting.
Professor Mendoza taught me how to square off the sides of the N10 W38</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">NW1/4 quarter. I learned how to use more archaeological
tools. The tools I used to square the sides with were pick axes, small
picks, measuring rope, and a level. When I found the artifacts, I learned
how to document where the ceramic (artifact) is located in the site. Then
I had to write and document how much the artifact weighed, length, width,
etc...Then I recorded the information onto the catalog card. The artifact
went into the bag with the catalog card. Finally, I obtained a better technique
and knowledge of how to wet/dry shift the excavation dirt. Besides the
ceramic, colored glass, I found more building material, bone and wood.
While I was excavating, Dr. Mendoza's tour group came through. So we</font>
<br><font face="Palatino">had to look like we knew what we were doing,
oh well...I would like to take his tour sometime to learn more about San
Juan Bautista, even though I have toured the site many times.</font>
