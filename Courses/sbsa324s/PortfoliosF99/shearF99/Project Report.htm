<FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>I went to the San Juan Bautista Mission for the first time today. I learned many new things about archaeology. I learned how to dig a site, find artifacts, and catalog the artifacts. I dug the site N-10, W-38, NE 1/4. When you dig a site you work in sections taking your time so you don't miss anything. It can get tedious, but when you find something of interest, it is worth all your time. Today my partner and I came across some stone tools. The most interesting one was orange colored. We also came across glass, bone, tile, and some cement. In this site we are trying to find the old foundation of the mission. That is why we are finding a lot of tile and glass. I found cataloging a lot of fun. When you catalog you have to put a number with it, tell what part of the site it came from, and put it into individual bags. I had a lot of fun digging and finding artifacts today. I can't wait till next Friday to dig some more and see if we can find the foundation.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>My second time out at the mission was just as interesting as the first. This time I had more of a handle on things. I knew what I was looking for, when I was screening. And I became a little more aggressive with my digging. In my site I think we are almost to 10 centimeters. So far we haven't found anything that interesting, because we are still at the surface. We are still just finding roof tiles, glass, wall, and bone. Although, I did find a small piece of English pottery. It was a small piece and could have been easily missed. It was a beautiful piece. It had small red flowers on it. That is what keeps me coming, the fact that you never know what you might find. </FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>This was my third time out to the mission and my fellow excavators and I have made it to our first objective of 20 centimeters. In those 20 centimeters you can see the different levels and can tell where there was disturbance from previous years. For example in one section there is a beer can which obviously didn't come from the 1800's. There weren't any huge discoveries today, but I hope to find more and can't wait to go back out again.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>This was my forth time out to the mission. We are now in the second objective, 20 cm into the site. We have not discovered any new material. We are still finding roof tiles and bone and some pottery. The ground we are working in is very hard and difficult to dig in. Because of this we have wet the site down once. We did not wet it down this time because I had a cold and thought it would be bad to play in cold mud. I am really enjoying the time I spend out at the mission. I hope to find something interesting next week. If not that is okay, because it is just fun to go out and dig in the dirt to find artifacts.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>This was my fifth time out at the mission and it was fairly productive. The ground had been saturated from the rains and it made it a lot easier to dig. We are now almost done with the second level. We haven't really found anything new, but we seem to be running into a lot of bone. They are good-sized pieces of bone too. We are hoping to hit the other wall of the nun's quarters once we reach the third level.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>This was my 6<SUP>th</SUP> and Final time out at the mission. We never found the foundation wall that we were looking for. Although we did find a lot of other interesting things. WE found lots of bone, tile and other miscellaneous things. I had a great time out at the mission each time I went there. It was a lot of fun working with people and was even better when we finally found something. When I was out there my partner and I would make up stories about our site that we were silly and fun. I had a great time out there and learned a lot of new stuff to take with me in my future classes.</FONT></TD>
