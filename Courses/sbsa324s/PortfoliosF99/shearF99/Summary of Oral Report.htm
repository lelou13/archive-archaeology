</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>&#9;I chose the field option so my oral report would have been on what I did out at the mission and what I learned by choosing that option.</P>
<P>&#9;I would start out talking about how I didn’t know a thing at first and was going into the project blind. How when I first started I was very nervous and hesitant to trust myself when screening the dirt. That my partner and I saved everything that we found the first few times and had Dr. Mendoza check to tell us what to keep. I would then go on to talk about how we eventually trusted ourselves to be the judge of what we were to keep. </P>
<P>&#9;For the second part of the presentation I would talk about what I learned and about the little stories that we made up while we were out at the mission.</P>
<P>I would talk about the different levels that we dig to and what they mean. I would explain all the different parts that you have to do when digging and screening. How we have to catalog each item that we find. Then I would sum up the presentation by telling them how much I learned and then taking questions.</P></FONT></BODY>
