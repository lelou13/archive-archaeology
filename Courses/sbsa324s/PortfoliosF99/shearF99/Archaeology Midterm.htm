</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>&#9;Overall I would just like you to know that this is the most fun I have had learning about a subject in a long time. I make all my friends jealous when I tell them we can go to a real site and dig. I absolutely love going to class in the morning, even though it is at 8 o’clock.</P>
<P>My reason for enrolling in this class was that it takes care of the first part of the ULR for science and it sounded pretty interesting considering the other choices. So far it is very interesting and keeps me engaged. It is the best science class I have taken in years. I would say that my reasons for taking the class have been met.</P>
<P>&#9;I have been to every class so far and have participated in every activity there has been. I think I involve my self more in certain deliverables than others. Such as the stone tool lab I find it very interesting and therefor I get into it more and try harder. Whereas when we are in groups talking about a film I tend to be less involved. While I may not be as involved in some I always complete the job at hand.</P>
<P>&#9;I find that my responses in the online journal are sometimes rushed and I don’t get to convey what I actually mean. My comments aren’t always reflective on the online journal; either because I feel rushed to get something posted or I just don’t have enough time to process my thoughts. Overall I would say that I am not satisfied with my responses to the online journal.</P>
<P>&#9;I choose the field option and have learned a lot from going out there. I now understand what archaeologists do and why they do it. I have learned what </P>
<P>goes into a site, all the measuring and guessing, what it is used for. I don’t think that I could understand everything by just reading a book. I really enjoy the hands on experience.</P>
<P>&#9;For my final project I am doing the fieldwork and keeping a journal. I write down what I do and learn each time that I go to the mission.</P>
<P>&#9;I really am enjoying the stone tools exercise. It is so much fun to really see and understand what goes into making a stone tool. I could never have really learned it by just watching a video. Especially because the person in the video makes it look so easy. When in actuality it is a very hard thing to master, which I found out. </P>
<P>&#9;The lab and field deliverables that are hands on are more effective in understanding the idea. When all we do is watch a video I don’t get as much out of it. I think at some point every student should have to go to the mission so they can see what it is really like to work at an actual site. </P>
<P>&#9;I am going to try and work on my journal entries. I would like to spend more time on them even if it means I have to Finnish them outside of class. I want to be able to really convey my ideas and what I have learned. </P></FONT></BODY>
