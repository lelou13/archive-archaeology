<P>Watching the video it was amazing to see how a stone could end up as a projectile point. I was amazed at how he could predict where the flake was going to break off and make the stone how he wanted it to be. He started with a big piece of obsidian breaking a big chunk off and producing a sharp blade used to cut leather then from there he made a serrated edge so he could cut meat. Slowly as he went through each thing he ended up with a projectile point. I think that Mr. Bradley does show the complexity of stone tool making and he shows the different ways and how you can predict where a flake will come off. I agree with him in the end when he says humans may not have evolved as far if there weren't stones that could break in that way.</TD>

<P>Chichen Itza was first discovered during the speculative period when people just guessed what was there without really looking into the site. From there people during the descriptive period went a little deeper and looked a little harder to find the answers. Augustus Le Plongeon found the site in the 1800's and found Chac Mool, which means Reclining Man of worrier. He chopped away the vegetation to find more. During the Historical period is when scholars from Harvard when to the palaces to find the treasures of the kings. They didn't look around the surrounding area, just at the obvious. After 1940 which is the explanatory period is when archaeologists began to look outside the obvious and look to the outskirts where there is just as much information. Archaeologists found that it was the Maya who had lived there and the archaeologist put together how the Maya lived. In the slides it showed how the city was laid out. Massive structures adorned with paintings and symbols that explain the history of these peoples. How the Maya's lived and how they sacrificed people. The slides showed the massive structures with the serpents and the gods in them. There is so much to discover about the Maya and how they lived.</TD>

<P>The Stone tool I have is 2.02 and the Munsell color is 10YR 5/4 (Moderate Yellowish Brown). The piece of stone I have is a flake it looks to me as if they decided not to finnish the tool. I can't see the bulb of percussion it looks like the bottom part was broken off. I think the method used on the flake was indirect percussion because there are ridges on the flake. There are also flake scars. One side of my flake is completely flat and I think it is the interior surface. The external surface has ridges and scars so I believe that is has to be external.</TD>

<P>The first artifact I observed was number 1.05. At first glance it looks like an arrow and probably was. It is grey and white and about one inch long. At the point of the arrow it is mostly grey and as you get to the bottom it is more white. There are ridges along the side which were probably to make the arrow sharper. My guess is that it was used for hunting. The second item I observed was number 4.9. It is flat on one side and raised on the other, kind of like a mountain. It has a long narrow end and then comes to a blunt point. It is light brown and about 1 1/4 inch long. I am not really sure what it was used for, maybe it was used for cleaning animals or smothing out an animal skin. Between the two artifacts I have observed, the two are very different. In the shape, size, and colors of both you can tell that they were probably used for very different things.</TD>

<P>The items found at the excavation site might tell us how they lived and what they did. In this site from these three items, the Chert core, Trade bead, and Bovine tooth. They could tell us that these people had some kind of money or trade system. A bead may have been traded for some grain. The tooth could be from something they ate. They may have hunted it with the tools they made. The chert core for the stone tool may have been used in hunting animals or some other type of food. With these three items you could conclude many things about the people who made or used them.</TD>

<P>The virtual dig helped me understand what kind of planning goes into a site that needs to be excavated. Figuring out how many people are needed for the dig and what kind of accommodations are needed helped me see what goes into a site. When we first submitted our proposal it was rejected because we didn't have enough people to dig and we didn't have the right specialists. When we went back in and changed some things around we got our proposal accepted although it wasn't perfect. The factors that I see that are most important to a dig is the number of people you have according to the number of excavation sites. There should be at least one person per site otherwise you will not get the job done. The other thing that I saw by doing this virtual dig is that you should pay the airfare for all the people who will be working on the site. That way if there isn't a person in the area who can do the job you can have someone flown into the site to do the job. Another thing I noticed is that you should have specialists according to the history of the site. If it is know that the site is really old you should have a person who can tell the difference between new and old humans. With this site we knew that we would probably find a lot of stone tools so we had a stone tool specialists. I found that when making a budget you should include all specialists and you should pay for everyone's airfare.</TD>

<P>If I were to restore a mission such as the San Juan Bautista mission. I would first restore the outside of the building so that the building wouldn't crumble. After restoring the building I would then start to restore the inside of the building. I would restore the statues, the paintings, and any structural problems inside. As for the paintings I would restore them to their natural colors and brilliance. I would use paints that were used when the paintings were created. I would want to see them how they were meant to be seen. After restoring the building inside and out I would start on the surrounding areas outside the building. I would restore the land to its natural state and pull out any plant life that isn't native to that mission.</TD>

<P>San Xavier del Bac is located on 14 acres in Tucson, Arizona. The mission was built by the Franciscan Priests of the area. The mission has been slowly deteriorating. The community surrounding the mission pulled together some funds and started to restore the mission to its original brilliance. Over the years the mission had only been repaired where needed. They repaired it with cement on the outside and on the inside they just painted over the paintings and many of them were gone. The community came together and started to repair the mission using natural materials that were used when the mission was built. They took the cement off of the building and replaced it with a natural mortar, made of cactus juice and other materials. On the inside they took all the layers of paint off to find their original paintings that were there. When they were finished the mission was restored to the natural brilliance and they left caretakers behind so the mission doesn't fall in to disrepair again.</TD>

<P>Collecting the flakes on the grid was very interesting. It was amazing all the different sizes you could get in one square. Documenting them was easy and I already knew how because I go to the mission on Fridays. I really enjoy the stone tool lab; it is a lot of fun. I learn better when it is hands on. Breaking the stone and then documenting it really shows what went on to make a stone tool. I now know from experience that getting a tool to be what you want is very difficult. I couldn't even break the stone at first, Dr. Mendoza had to do the first break then I was able to get some good flakes. It was difficult to determine how hard to hit the stone. That was the hardest thing for me.</TD>

<P>Today in class we watched a the CNN special called "Food to Die For" which was about garbology. The University of Colorado garbology class studied various families and found that most families basically lied about what they were consuming. One particular student found that while the family he was studying said they were eating healthy foods, they were in actuality eating poorly. The student found a lot of fast food wrappers and other quick foods. We also looked at another case study about a couple that ran a day care. The study looked at the consumption of liquids. In the beginning the couple was drinking a lot of beer and Pepsi and there was also a lot of CapriSun. When the researcher confronted the couple about the consumption of alcohol, the next week it dropped dramatically. We looked at one more case study which was done on a male. From his garbage you could tell that he had had a cold was preparing for a date and that he didn't like to cook. From these three examples of garbology studies it seems to me that you can tell a lot about a person from their garbage. By studying a persons trash you can tell what there diet it, you can tell if they are sick or if they have just cleaned. You can tell what there lifestyle is like. A person who eats a lot of fast food is most likely on the run and very busy with no time to make a decent meal. Most people probably think they are eating right when in actuality they aren't eating very well. Everyone should go through their garbage to see how they are really eating.</TD>
