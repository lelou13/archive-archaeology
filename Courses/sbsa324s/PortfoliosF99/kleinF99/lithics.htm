<P>Archaeology Lithics Lab Deliverable</P>

<P>&#9;The intent of this deliverable is to describe and explain the graphical representations of the sampling squares that were undertaken in the lithics lab exercise.  The first portion of that assignment involved flintknapping, that is, making stone tools with volcanic glass.  An unavoidable byproduct of flintknapping is the creation of debitage.  Debitage is the debris created when flakes of all sizes are chipped off of the obsidian with another stone or percussive device.  Other devices include antlers, rocks, bone, copper wire, and chest punches.  </P>
<P>&#9;Debitage is a useful study aid as it is how archaeologists make generalizations and assumptions in the field.  By examining debitage, one can deduce where and what stone tools where made, and in what fashion.  By participating in this lab, I can see firsthand the dedication, danger, and skill involved in making stone tools.  </P>
<P>&#9;The second portion of this assignment was the collection and the cataloguing of the materials.  This was done by dividing the floor, where the debris was scattered, into a grid of letters and numbers.  I excavated two squares of the grid, B5 and H6.  These squares were drawn randomly, meaning I had an equal chance to pick this square as any other, from a bin filled with numbers on the grid.  Truthfully, this is not the case, because of the fact that others had picked before me.  In this sense, it was not a truly random sample.  </P>
<P>&#9;Square B5 had relatively few flakes of obsidian.  I found and catalogued 20 pieces of less than one centimeter in length, 15 of between one and two centimeters, and 5 of two to three centimeters in length.  This square was a breeze compared to some of the other squares that were heavily influenced by the presence of debitage.  My representation of this square is located on the next page.  It shows three sets of two bars each.  Each set of bars represents the quantity and weight of the debitage fitting that length classification.  The legend on the left side of the paper clues in the reader that the lighter gray represents the count, that is, weight of flakes of that particular size in the square, and the darker gray represents the  number of flakes meeting that length classification.  For example, the first set of columns tells the reader that there were 20 flakes representing 1.9 grams of debitage in square B5 that were less than one centimeter in length.  That is a lot of information for one graph!</P>
<P>&#9;Square H6 was a nearly empty square.  I only found miniscule fragments in this sector.  I scraped these together and estimated their numbers at 100.  Their weight was barely negligible, as shown in the bar-graph.  This graph is set up exactly like the one previous, with the exception that there is only one length classification shown.  This only means that there were approximately 100 flakes of obsidian of less than one centimeter in length, weighing around 3 grams, in square H6 of the grid.  Again, this is a lot of information for one graph.  To take full advantage of this information, we would have to look at graphs of all the squares sampled.</P>
<P>&#9;With all of this information at our fingertips, I would conduct a search to examine where the highest concentration of debitage was located.  This would allow us to deduce accurately where the person was flaking, whether or not they were left or right handed, and the materials used to make the stone tool.  This information would allow us to make generalizations of long-ago ages and customs with some accurate basis in contemporary reality.  That is, archaeology of today is allowing us to understand yesterday.  The purpose of this understanding is to benefit those of us living today in a significant fashion.    </P></FONT></BODY>
