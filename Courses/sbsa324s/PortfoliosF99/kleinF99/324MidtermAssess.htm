<P>Major Deliverable 1:  Self-Assessment</P>
<P>SBSA 324s</P>

<P>&#9;My objective for involvement in this class is to become more aware of archaeological tools and techniques while fulfilling my upper division service learning.  I could have taken other SBSC service learning classes, but I chose this one for its’ content.  I have never before participated in field archaeology, which I find an interesting and worthwhile task.  Interesting because I am learning techniques that would allow me to participate in archaeological research around the globe, and worthwhile because it is through our work that we can gain a better understanding of the way Mission San Juan Bautista both operated in the past and how it continues to affect us today.  According to my motivation for taking this class, I consider my objectives being completed satisfactorily.</P>
<P>&#9;I have attended nearly all of our class meetings.  Deliverables that I have completed include map sampling, a video review, a material cultures assessment, an excavation methods review, a readings review, and a stone tools analysis.  I enjoyed the stone tools analysis lab deliverable, in which we watched a movie and a demonstration on flintknapping, and then had the opportunity to try it ourselves.  I have made an earnest attempt in completing all the lab and field deliverables to date.</P>
<P>&#9;My first entries in the online journal are &quot;sparse.&quot;  I do not think that I took it seriously at first, and I think that my entries will reflect that.  I have come to the realization that these entries are a primary indicator of our participation in the class, and I have subsequently put more effort and quality.  My reluctance to elaborate on the online journal stems from my perception that I am writing to a computer, and not a person.  I think that this feels slightly awkward, when I have been conditioned to write for people.  This must be the price one pays for living in the twentieth century...</P>
<P>&#9;My work at the field site has shown me how real archaeology works.  There is a lot of paperwork!  This paperwork makes possible relevant analysis, but doesn’t make for the speediest of excavations.  I have also learned an appreciation for even the smallest of historical artifacts.  It is like winning the lottery when I find a shard of ceramic or a nail.  This work also requires the development of interpersonal skills, as we frequently interact with others who hold interesting perspectives.</P>
<P>&#9;Our introduction and contact with flintknapping has been the highlight of the lab deliverable for me.  I think that to teach this in a college level course is an excellent way to foster respect for diverse points of view, namely, cavemen!  I enjoy fooling around with what my ancestors depended on for survival.  Plus, there is a sense of accomplishment involved when you create your own crude projectile point.  I also enjoyed the codex analysis.  My least favorite deliverable was most likely the video review.  I am simply not that fascinated by watching a concedingly informative video while there are probably other, more involving techniques out there to get the information across.</P>
<P>&#9;I plan on improving upon my performance by increasing the quality of my online journal entries, as well as the quantity of my visits to Mission San Juan Bautista.  I think that by implementing these objectives I will significantly increase the benefit that the class receives from me, and that I receive from the class.  My strengths regarding this class are best demonstrated during my participation in field archaeology.  With a few exceptions while I was starting out, I am meticulous in recording the detail and circumstance of the traces of material culture that I am lucky enough to find.  Another strength I have is to work with people whom I would normally not associate with in order to come to a common objective, namely the organized preservation of historical objects.</P></FONT></BODY>
