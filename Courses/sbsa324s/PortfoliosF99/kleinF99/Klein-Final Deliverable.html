<P>&#9;</B>Traveling south on Highway One from Monterey, California, it is only a few minutes drive to the exclusive community of Pebble Beach.  Five gates guard the entrances to this area; these gates symbolize the upper class status of those living inside, as well as the desire of the residents to find a sense of community in our turbulent modern world.  In this essay, I will explain the theory of conspicuous consumption and how it relates to those those who choose to live in gated communities.</P>
<P>&#9;Thorstein Veblen&#146;s theory of the leisure class consists of several components, conspicuous leisure, conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, and the leisure class.  These concepts stem from the aversion of the upper class from performing productive tasks, leaving these tasks to the working class.  Conspicuous leisure occurs when an individual takes efforts to let others know that they rarely, if ever, engage in laborious activities.  The long fingernails of powerful Chinese are an example of this type of leisure, because it allows them to display their separation from work that would break the nails.  It can be said that learning and playing the game of golf is a form of conspicuous leisure, an activity that often occurs within gated communities, including Pebble Beach.  Retirement communities often offer scheduled activities, the participation of which let others know that you are not working.</P>
<P>&#9;Conspicuous consumption occurs when an individual purchases or uses an expensive item when another of lesser value would suffice.  The prestige given to the individual comes from the acknowledgment that the item is not a necessity.  The object then becomes a symbol of status, and is often emulated by the lower classes.  This emulation, or the imitation of consumption habits, keeps the upper class empowered and in their high social position.  As long as someone is imitating you, you hold a certain degree of power over them.  This trend can be reflected in the advertising industry as well, where the point is to try and coerce populations to emulate someone or something through their consumer habits.  Huge mansions serve as symbols of conspicuous consumption when they are excessively larger than needed to be comfortable.  Having just taken a drive down Pebble Beach, I can say that the majority of the houses located there are larger than necessary.  I even observed one home with a private putting green in the front yard, located just beyond a large adobe styled mansion.  Gated communities will often have elaborate gates, sometimes with towers and guards.  These gates offer a way for the residents inside to display their wealth to the outside world, as a cheaper gate could have the same theoretical purpose of exclusion at a much lower cost.  Sculpted gates are much more appealing and indicative of wealth than are barbed wire.  Another way in which gates serve to accumulate wealth for homeowners is through stability that they create.  Homeowner associations create regulations for residents living within the development to follow in order to stabilize property values.  Rules concerning parking, home modification, and who is allowed to come in and out of a development can help to heighten the sense of exclusivity that can be a motivating factor for homeowners wishing to live in a gated community.  The gates restricting free access into Pebble Beach create an atmosphere lacking interaction of the lower classes, which the wealthy often desire as a means to disassociate  themselves.  </P>
<P>&#9;According to Veblen, conspicuous waste occurs when a person undertakes a task that does not produce a useful finished product.  This waste can consist of time, effort, or money.  By this definition, we can see that this waste can and does include conspicuous consumption and the waste of time that occurs when one engages in conspicuous leisure.  Being able to spend time learning obsolete languages instead of engaging in an occupation in order to feed your family allows one to demonstrate their social status by their disinclination toward work.</P>
<P>&#9;The theory of the leisure class requires one group to dominate another for the purposes of economic gain and the removal of one group directly from work.  One interesting note that I came across was Veblen&#146;s idea that the earliest form of this practice was the domination and subservience of women.  Women have traditionally cooked and cared for the family, while men have engaged in hunting and warfare, contributing less toward the common good.  This is known as vicarious conspicous consumption, the &quot;Publicly visible nonproductive use of wealth by one person that leads to a gain in social status by another person.&quot;  (Ashley &amp; Orenstien, 444)  One of the primary reasons why one would seek to live in a gated community would be for the close proximity toward activities that can demonstrate one&#146;s wealth.  Pebble Beach, for example, has five golf courses, polo field, and equestrian center.  </P>
<P>&#9;The equestrian center located in Pebble Beach illustrates another form of conspicuous ownership, that of expensive animals.  The text of <U>The Theory of the Leisure Class</U>  features a photograph of a well-to-do couple in a car holding the leash of a large dog.  In this sense, dogs can demonstrate the wealth of their owner because they arguably do not serve any purpose, such as a cat&#146;s ability to catch mice.  The horses kept by residents in Pebble Beach are yet another symbol of the wealth of their owner, as the transportation that horses offer has been rendered obsolete by the automobile.  When a person can afford not only to demonstrate their capacity for idle time, but the idleness of their animals and other purchases, it allows for a further degree of conspicuous ownership.  This can be extended to include servants that may not be needed all of the time, but are kept on hand as a symbol of the household&#146;s wealth.  Servants and gates can be representative of the social status of a person, but not all people live in gated communities live their for prestigious motivations.</P>
<P>&#9;Homeowners can decide to install gates into their community for security reasons, as well.  Gates can act to slow down traffic in a congested area, as well as to serve as a physical barrier between an undesirable element of society.  Criminals are commonly this element and gates can give residents an added feeling of security.  If I were to try and scientifically determine whether the gates guarding a community were for prestigious or security reasons, I would conduct focus groups of individuals living in these communities.</P>
<P>&#9;My focus groups would ideally consist of six to nine persons chosen randomly from a list of residents.  I would try to compose my groups of equal gender ratios, in order to represent fairly men and women.  From these focus groups I would ask questions of the residents concerning their attitude toward the gate that supposedly protects them.  My questions would inquire into what the participants know about gated communities, how they feel about them, and how they act as a result of their proximity toward these gates.  I would inquire as to how the gates influenced their decision to live in that particular area, and if their attitudes had changed as a result of experiencing the warm embrace of the gates.  I would hypothesize that prestige communities would be apparent from the road, without having to conduct a focus group, because of their extravagant nature and function of instilling awe to the bystander.  A mail out questionnaire could be used, but I think that a focus group would allow for greater discussion of a difficult to define topic.  A survey or a questionnaire might not address all of the categories of answers that participants may wish to answer, and thus may contaminate the results.  Community can mean different things to different people, and I believe that research concerning this interpretive topic could best be explored through a facilitator and a focus group.  These methods would give me qualitative data from the focus groups as well as quantitative data from the questionnaires.</P>
<P>&#9;Utilizing these two data methods would allow me to triangulate my research methods by using more than one method to collect data on the same topic.  My resulting analysis and conclusions would have more of a holistic nature because of my reliance on two data methods.  Whereas one method may be impractical or invalid in a certain situation, I would hope that the other method would catch this oversight.  Conclusions that I come to based on one data collection method will be much more believable when confirmed by similar results attained by using another method.  It is my belief that the focus group would be the source of the majority of my useful information, with the survey serving as a backup to catch information that may not be apparent through a focus group.  </P>
<P>&#9;I believe that these methods would best allow me to explore and measure the attitudes, cognitions, and values of people toward gated communities.  Are the gates doing the job that they were erected to perform?  Why, or why not?  I think that a collection and analysis of data of this type would be extremely valuable to a real estate developer considering the addition of gates to his or her proposed development.  I would like to find out if gates would allow me to command a higher price for my homes, as well as if the expense of constructing them would be justified.  As a researcher I am interested in the effect that gates have on a person&#146;s everyday life, and the attitudes and opinions formed as a result of the gate.  I am curious as to whether gates have an actual effect in reducing crime, or just in making residents feel safer.  I would analyze before and after statistical crime data from a newly gated community in order to find out this particular aspect.  Certain communities would not be appropriate for this type of crime data, such as Pebble Beach, because the gates have been there since 1882.  I doubt if there are crime data from 1880s Pebble Beach.</P>
<P>&#9;I believe that gated communities allow us an interesting look into the social values held by society, whether those values be the status of one individual over another or the exclusion of a perceived threat, such as an age or racial class.  When applied to Thorstein Veblen&#146;s theory of the leisure class, some gated communities fit right in to the conspicuous consumption component.  I have found that the social attitudes dealing with Pebble Beach have been appropriately articulated by Veblen nearly 100 years ago and are still valid today.</P>
<P>The fact that this theory has if anything grown more appropriate over time is a testament to the theoretical aptitude of Veblen, although his theory of the leisure class has been considered by some to be a satire of the wealthy.  Veblen&#146;s theories have furthered my understanding of what it means to be wealthy and refined, as well as how others attempt to achieve the same, namely by pecuniary emulation.  </P>
<P>&#9;In this essay, I have used Veblen&#146;s theory of the leisure class in order to illustrate the concept of the gated community, my unit of analysis.  I have reported on the data collection techniques that I would use to apply this theory to the use of specific research methods, as well as on the measurement of values, cognitions, and attitudes of individuals impacted by gates and gated communities.  </P>
