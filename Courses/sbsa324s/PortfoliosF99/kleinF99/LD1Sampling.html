<B>Directions:</B>&nbsp; You will be provided a topographic
map of the archaeological site of Xochicalco, Morelos, Mexico.&nbsp; Xochicalco,
which rose to prominence in the period of the Epiclassic (ca. A.D. 600-900),
has been extensively mapped and excavated.&nbsp; As such, we will use this
site for the purposes of determining the extent to which different types
of sampling strategies are effective.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the transparency overlay of the alphanumeric
grid provided by your instructor, you will use four distinct strategies
for determining areas that you believe will yield significant archaeological
materials.&nbsp; Place the left edge of the transparency grid (i.e., the
left edge of column "1") at the left margin of the topo map.&nbsp; Place
the top edge of the transparency grid (i.e., the top edge of row "A") at
the top margin of the topo map.&nbsp; The strategies for selecting units
is as follows:
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the transparency and its alphanumeric grid
to select ten grid units at random from the map of Xochicalco.&nbsp; This
selection is strictly random and can be based on any logic or random order
that you choose.
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select five transect columns or rows (e.g., Row
= Letters; Column = Numbers) at random.
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select ten units on the basis of where you would
expect to find habitation or settlement in the area of the map given such
considerations as the presence of water, topography, defense, etc.
<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, select five units on the basis of a stratified
sampling that excludes steep cliffs and those areas not specifically included
within the topographically-mapped portions of the Xochicalco mapping.&nbsp;
You may also exclude hills and gorges and or valleys if you wish.
<P>Note: After you have made your selections, please enter comments into
the Online Journal that would serve to provide your professor with some
idea of what your sampling strategy entailed...in other words, what logic
or random ordering went into your selections.
<P>Having completed your entries into the Online Journal, your professor
will reveal the settlement history and mapping of the site for the period
of A.D. 500 and then A.D. 600.&nbsp; Once you have had a chance to compare
the actual settlement mappings with your sampling predictions, please indicate
in comments posted to the Online Journal how well you did in selecting
grid units or transects that revealed buried settlement sites.&nbsp; Please
indicate the grid unit numbers that correspond with actual settlement.&nbsp;
Which of the strategies proved most effective to the development of your
sample and your predication of ancient settlements?</BLOCKQUOTE>
