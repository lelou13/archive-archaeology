<P>&#9;This deliverable will serve as a basis for feedback and reflection regarding my progress in the meeting the requirements of Archaeology:  Map to Museum.  This learning experience in Fall of 1999 has introduced me to techniques of analysis, flintknapping, and archaeological methods.</P>
<P>&#9;I enrolled in this class to fulfill my upper division service learning.  I could have chosen other courses to fulfill this requirement, but the content of this course intrigued me.  I wanted to see what else the Social and Behavioral Science department had to offer.  I feel like I have received quite a sample of what this institute can give a student, including archaeological and research methods, theory, analysis, and critical thinking.  I enrolled in this course to see how archeology would fit into this rubric that I have set according to the standards of the other learning experiences that I have had.</P>
<P>&#9;This course combines the study of ancient cultures and people with contemporary methods.  This is different from other disciplines in that it simultaneously focuses on two different time periods:  the present and the past.  Using the present to make assumptions about the past and vice versa seem to me to be a large part of archaeological method and analysis.  This was an interesting perspective for me to glance at while applying this method to other aspects of my academic career.  Studying the present and the past will benefit any work that I intend to do on the former Fort Ord, that has now become an educational institution.  Looking at the whole picture seems to be the lesson that I have learned through this course.</P>
<P>&#9;The lab deliverables were interesting for the  most part, with the exception of some of the videos that we watched in class.  I think that time could have perhaps been spent in more fulfilling ways than watching the dry video on flintknapping.  I must say, though, this video did pay off when we began hands-on work with obsidian.  Perhaps watching the video after an introduction to this art might be more effective.  I enjoyed the flintknapping lab deliverable and would have liked to participate in the garbology experiment.  This would be an interesting analysis.  As a social scientist, I question the accuracy of garbology where the subject know that they are being studied and hence may censor their trash.  Similarly, I question the ethics involved in clandestine raids of garbage cans.  This predicament seems to be a lose-lose situation, where bias will present itself in any situation.  This situation is representative of other social sciences, in that true objectivity is impossible for any researcher.  I have attended nearly all of the class meetings and lab deliverables.  I have participated in six archaeological sessions at Mission San Juan Bautista.  I have engaged myself to complete the deliverables and the online portfolio and spent quite a bit of time on them.</P>
<P>&#9;I have utilized the online portfolio more extensively in the second half of the semester.  I initially did not take this seriously, but have come to the realization that it is a primary indicator of class participation.  I have therefore put more emphasis and detail into my journals.  As Dr. Mendoza replied to my comment about writing to a machine, not only am I writing to my professor, but to my peers as well.  Perhaps I have taken this information to heart and consider the computer to be not an automaton, but a method of disseminating information to my classmates and professor.  I am satisfied with my responses to questions and deliverables that I have posted in the second half of the class.  </P>
<P>&#9;At the field site, I have learned archeological techniques and a little about the politics of working in close quarters with those whom I do not necessarily chose to spend my time with.  This teamwork forces an understanding that you are working together to come to a common goal.  I learned about cataloguing techniques, the less glorious part of the archeological process.  This tagging of information to the artifact is time consuming, and normally saved for the end of the day.  Nevertheless, the information required to meaningfully interpret the artifacts is necessary.  Learning how to catalog this information was in important part of the learning process.  </P>
<P>&#9;Key concepts that have been of most importance to me during this course are the emphasis placed on ancient cultures and this application in the field.  We were lucky enough to have a professor with an interest in ancient Mexico.  I found Dr. Mendoza's lectures interesting on this subject, as well as the lab deliverables that went along with this subject.  When this knowledge was applied in the field, it created a sense of scholarly analysis among the rubble.  That is, connections that I could not make with my background were pointed out and made sense.  </P>
<P>&#9;I enjoyed this class and would recommend it to someone wishing to fulfill either a science or a service learning requirement.  I would also recommend taking this class with a friend or a carpool buddy so that getting to San Juan Bautista does not become a mission on it's own.</P></BODY>
