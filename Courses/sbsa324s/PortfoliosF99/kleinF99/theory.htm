<P>Theory is the line drawn between events analogous to a game of dot-to-dot.  The events, or dots, that are being connected by theory can be any occurrences that are of interest.  Any relationship between events that is unprovable is a theory.  A provable relationship would be a fact and could be used in further testing other theories.  For example, I am interested in the influence of the military on those not in the armed forces.  The two dots that I wish to connect are the military and society at large.  My theory is that the military affects civilians through spectacle and force.  This relationship between two groups of interest examines a connection that may be present.  A further connection that I may wish to make would be the connection between the dominant worldview of capitalism and the military.  This theory might study the dependence of one on the other for the existence of a global or local economy.  </P>
<P>&#9;A theory need not only examine two entities.  It can be one-to-many or many-to-one.  It can travel up through the power structure or into the heavens to speculate on interplanetary relations.  Conclusions drawn from events are drawn from applying the events into theoretical frameworks.  That is to say, if details from a relationship of events are support an existing theory, then the validity of that theory would increase.  A theory cannot be incorrect.  Theories are not subject to absolutes such as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot;  Theories can be statistically insignificant, but as long as the speculation exists than so does the theory.  If a theory were proved &quot;right,&quot; it would become a fact, were it proved &quot;wrong,&quot; support would simply vanish, not the theory.  </P>
<P>&#9;When a theory attempts to identify a relationship between a human source and another event that may or may not be human, then the theory can be further identified as a social or behavioral theory.  A social theory would focus on at least one human trait or feature or relationship.  For example, studying the pull of the earth’s gravity on the moon would not be a social theory, while studying the pull of a Mountain Dew commercial on teenage consumption would.  Social theory includes individual and group influence and expectation on a person, as well as the effect of inanimate objects on a person.  It seems that with the advent of computers, even inanimate objects can be subject to social theory.  The formation of online communities and communications can attest to the social implications of the interpersonal exchange on the internet.  Theories that explain social phenomena are the sole purpose of the social and behavioral sciences, predicting and controlling human behavior.</P>
<P>&#9;Without theory, making assumptions or generalizations regarding humans would be limited to fact.  With vastly different customs and upbringings, finding commonalities among <I>all </I>humans would be limited to biological similarities.  Theory allows us to take a step back, and say, &quot;Perhaps <I>x</I> doesn’t always cause <I>y</I>, but it seems the logical explanation in this case.&quot;  If the relationship between <I>x </I> and <I>y </I>were a universal truth, than it would be a fact not subject to disagreement or question.</P>
<P>&#9;Facts are linked through theory.  These facts could be the dots that are linked, or the reinforcement and measure of the theory.  For example, &quot;the earth is round&quot; and &quot;gravity exists&quot; could be linked through theory in order to explain the spherical shape of the earth.  As explained above, this would not be social theory, as none of the parties involved are human.  One might theorize that &quot;the boy who listened to Marilyn Manson shot himself&quot; did so out of subliminal messages in the music.  In this case, facts can help weed out the true culprit by determining that there were in fact no hidden messages on the album.  A social theorist might examine this case in light of family relationships, the media, or achievement depending on their particular discipline.  Facts contextualize the events being studied by contrasting fact with conjecture.  Theory links truisms and provides a basis for speculation.  Social and behavioral science theory attempts to examine factual occurrences that deal with at least one person.</P>
<P>&#9;Historical analysis is one issue that contemporary social theory deals with.  In this discipline, facts of the past are examined  in light of social phenomenon.  It is hoped that this understanding will aid in analysis of contemporary problems through the interpretation of similar past experience.  Theories of demographics and migration can aid in development and planning of cities, businesses, schools, and social systems such as welfare.  Privatized systems such as prisons and healthcare rely on social theory to plan ahead by examining fact.  Socio-economic breakdowns of current populations can be scrutinized under theories of growth, morbidity, and any other unknown in order to enact legislation and strategies for the future.  Anthropological and archeological sites are studied using social and behavioral theory in an attempt to better understand aspects of culture.  Often this culture is foreign from our own, especially when dealing with past civilizations.  When factual evidence from these disciplines is contrasted with contemporary society, we can theorize about the role of technology, music, or food in the lives of people.  Major issues in the social and behavioral sciences include interpersonal relationships, the influence of people on institutions, the influence of institutions on people, and the methodologies involved in collecting evidence.  Theory can then be supported or refuted based on the data collected.  The theories that I have examined in my deliverables examine the effects of people on institutions and the effects of institutions on people.</P>
<P>&#9;Communitarianism is a theory that has been developed by Amitai Etzioni.  Main tenets of this way of thinking include an emphasis on social and civic responsibility.  It is through this increased accountability of all members of the community that improved living and working conditions are achieved.  This accountability could come in the form of jury duty or even beach cleanup.  This is a controversial theory in that is advocates reduced individual liberty for community benefit.  I think that people do not have a problem with the principles of a cleaner, efficient community.  Instead, the increased obligation that communitarianism requires is a turn-off for many people.  This theory studies the effects of people on social institutions and the changes that can supposedly brought about.  As I have mentioned before, theories cannot be "wrong."  In this case, disagreement on the efficacy of its' principles have made this theory unpopular with many people hesitant to sacrifice protection that is granted under the Constitution.  The theory of communitarianism has been applied with some success in countries that see it as an aid in constructing community rather than infringing on independence.</P>
<P>&#9;Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class addresses the impact of the behavior of the wealthy.  The main tenets of this theory are conspicuous leisure, conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, and the leisure class.  Great relevance is placed on the spending habits, clothing, pets, and hobbies of those not required to work for a living.  Conspicuous leisure occurs when one takes efforts to let others know that they rarely engage in productive activity.  Bound feet or long fingernails are examples of a person's demonstration that they are absolved from labor.  Conspicuous waste occurs when one invests in a task that does not provide a useful product.  This investment could be time, money, or effort.  Conspicuous consumption is the purchase of an object that conveys status and prestige, when an affordable object may serve the same functionality.  I address the conspicuous consumption of those living in gated communities in two deliverables on the Theory of the Leisure Class.  The leisure class requires emulation.  This means that when the lower classes mimic consumption habits of the wealthy, their power is only reinforced.  This theory examines the effects of an institutionalized upper class on people, generally those not able to live amidst the gates.  </P>
<P>&#9;The theories that I write about in my deliverables are the lines drawn between factual events.  As far as communitarianism is concerned, the lines are connecting dots of civic responsibility, rights, and community.  Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class examines the factual existence of wealth, consumption, and emulation.  Facts and theory are mutually dependant in these theories, much like a pencil is required to complete a dot-to-dot.        </P>
