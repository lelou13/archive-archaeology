<P>      I selected sites that I thought would be the easily defended. In a society wrought with</P>
<P>      conflict, higher elevations are more desireable for safety and defense. This was my</P>
<P>      rationale for choosing (not quite randomly) j13, k9, k5, p5, q3, p13, l9, m5, q10, l3. I</P>
<P>      chose l, p, k, q, and 8 as transects because it seems that they intersect areas of high</P>
<P>      elevation on the topographical map. My stratified sample of five squares consists of</P>
<P>      j13, k9, l3, q10, and p5. This is the condensed version of the first ten squares I chose</P>
<P>      to excavate on the site of Xochicalco. </P>

<P>      Mapping is essential to documenting and recording discoveries. Spatial</P>
<P>      relationships can be analyzed using geographic coordinates of a mapped location.</P>
<P>      These analyses can provide insight through proximity to resources such as water</P>
<P>      and fertile land. Accurate recording of the locations of artifacts within a site is</P>
<P>      important in understanding past behaviors and events.</P>

<P>      I was unsuccessful in all prediction attempts for the excavation site at Xochicalco. I</P>
<P>      was one square away from La Parcelo, but I doubt that proximity would have helped</P>
<P>      me in this case. I was somewhat accurate in my prediction of transects p and 8. Both</P>
<P>      of these had traces of settlement on the map. I would have had much success when</P>
<P>      the secondary map/settlement was displayed.</P>

<P>      The Divine Mission of San Xavier Del Bac is a mission near Tucson, Arizona that is</P>
<P>      currently operational. It is the recipient of a fortunate, needed, and costly artwork</P>
<P>      restoration project that appeared to have a vivid aesthetic affect on the mission and</P>
<P>      its' services. The participants of the restoration included several Italians who had</P>
<P>      previous experience with chapels and missions. One resident of the town ended up</P>
<P>      marrying one of the restoration crew in Europe! The movie played up this marriage a</P>
<P>      bit, and cute as it was, it seemed a little off in this documentary. This mission was</P>
<P>      built in a tumultuous time of American and Mexican history. Built just as Mexico was</P>
<P>      becoming independant of Spain, this mission was abandoned by the Franciscans</P>
<P>      and occupied by the Spanish a few years later. The townspeople kept the church in</P>
<P>      various states of repair, until a non-profit organization was founded in 1978 to repair</P>
<P>      and preserve the church. I think that re-doing the masonry was a very important part</P>
<P>      of the restoration that is perhaps less glamorous than restoring artwork, but perhaps</P>
<P>      more necessary. I would like to see some of the same restoration happening at</P>
<P>      Mission San Juan Bautista, where I might be able to enjoy these colonial artworks in</P>
<P>      thier intended splendor.</P>

<P>      Myths and Moundbuilders was the name of the film we watched today in class. One</P>
<P>      of the myths pertaining to the moundbuilders was that they were not built by</P>
<P>      ancestors of Indians found in the Ohio floodplains, rather, they were built by a</P>
<P>      "superior" race that had been in transit to Mexico. This racist hypothesis began to be</P>
<P>      disproved when skeletal comparisons found no distinguishable difference between</P>
<P>      ancient remains and modern Native American's skull and body type. I believe that</P>
<P>      this myth arose from archaeologists' disbelief in the abilities of Native Americans.</P>
<P>      The mound reconstruction was beneficial to archaeology in that is assigned some</P>
<P>      quantitave measure to the time requirments needed to construct an earthen mound.</P>
<P>      This experiment would also serve to give those involved an appreciation of what</P>
<P>      mounds are and what it takes to build them. This experiment could have served as to</P>
<P>      belittle the Native American's abilities, as the message that I received from the film</P>
<P>      was that they were fairly easily constructed, and that a decent sized mound could be</P>
<P>      built in one afternoon. It seems to me that salvage archaeology is often undertaken</P>
<P>      with considerable pressure from outside sources. Time constraints and construction</P>
<P>      deadlines would limit the thoroghness that an archaeologist would ideally strive for.</P>
<P>      At least some preliminary work is being done in these cases, instead of bulldozing</P>
<P>      and paving these ancient mounds and the artifacts within. Salvage archaeology is</P>
<P>      the recovering of artifacts. Unfortunately, deadlines limit the quality of the work being</P>
<P>      done. This is both a good thing and a bad thing, in that at least the work is being</P>
<P>      done, unfortunately, often underaken in less than ideal conditions. </P>

<P>      "Flintknapping" was the title of the video that we watched in class today. Bruce</P>
<P>      Bradley took us through the process of creating different stone tools to help in the</P>
<P>      killing, skinning, carving, and hide preparation involved in hunting a bison. Using both</P>
<P>      small and large antlers, and different sized stones, Bruce created tools using</P>
<P>      pressure and percussive flaking. Pressure flaking was used to create a serrated</P>
<P>      edge, as well as for the delicate sharpening and notching procedures. Bruce used a</P>
<P>      notched antler and a small antler tip for pressure flaking. For percussive flaking,</P>
<P>      Bruce used the blunt end of a larger antler and two different sized stones. The larger</P>
<P>      of these stones was used to flake off a large piece of obsidian from the</P>
<P>      "motherchip." The smaller stone was used to thin down and shape the flake so that</P>
<P>      the antlers could be used. I think that a short video like this does a great job of</P>
<P>      introducing students to flintknapping, but can hardly do justice to hundreds of</P>
<P>      thousands of years of stone tool craftsmanship. An accurate and in-depth</P>
<P>      documentary of stone tools throughout human history would be a mammoth</P>
<P>      semester-long undertaking. This video did precisely what it was supposed to do,</P>
<P>      stimulate interest in flintknapping.</P>

<P>      The items found at mission San Juan Bautista can show us what the residents of the</P>
<P>      mission were eating, wearing, and making during that time period. Recovered</P>
<P>      beads can show possible trade routes by tracing their origins. The bovine tooth</P>
<P>      could offer evidence of a food source or of accepted farming practices like plowing</P>
<P>      and planting. The chert core for flaking stone tools can help us predict the tools that</P>
<P>      were being made and being used at that time in the mission. These items of</P>
<P>      material culture are examples of everyday life; the way things were a hundred or</P>
<P>      more years ago. These three items taken together can tell us more than can the sum</P>
<P>      of the individual items. For example, the chert core taken in conjunction with the</P>
<P>      bovine tooth could lead to an educated guess of what kinds of plows, harnesses,</P>
<P>      and other farming equipment were being used at the time. </P>

<P>      Artifact # 4.50 I believe the color of my small obsidian-like object is 5YR 3/2. This is</P>
<P>      an arrowhead like tool with a very dark red/black hue. The approximate dimensions</P>
<P>      are one half inch by one quarter inch by one eighth of an inch. This artifact may have</P>
<P>      come from a McKean site. It appears to be bifaced, as both sides were most likely</P>
<P>      used. I think this object was created using first indirect percussion and then pressure</P>
<P>      flaking. This object is secondary, as it has some cortex. It looks as if the object was</P>
<P>      flaked on one side more than the other. Description to be increased...</P>

<P>      The ancient city of Chichen Itza on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico affords many</P>
<P>      examples of sculpture, architecture, and daily life of an ancient civilization. Early</P>
<P>      scholars and archaeologists like Augustus LePlongeon came into these sites in the</P>
<P>      mid 1800s to look for leftover artifacts of the elite. In the process they described what</P>
<P>      the found and theorized about the origins of not only the artifacts that they found but</P>
<P>      the motivation of everyday events depicted in the city. The quality of the excavated</P>
<P>      carvings in the 1800s made early scholars very fortunate observers of Mayan culture.</P>
<P>      Today, we are still lucky enough to see these carvings, but not in the same splendor</P>
<P>      as they were 100 years ago. Erosion and fading due to sun, wind, and rain have</P>
<P>      faded the paint and physical intensity, but not the impression that they leave on an</P>
<P>      inquisitive mind. This site is important to the field of archaeology in that it makes a</P>
<P>      connection between ancient and contemporary Maya. Cultural swapping, such as the</P>
<P>      transposition of similar buildings, can be interpreted to show us patterns of migration</P>
<P>      and emigration.</P>

<P>      Research design are the methodologies an archaeologist follows while in the field.</P>
<P>      These methods vary from dig site to dig site, depending on such variables as soil</P>
<P>      type and type of artifacts present. One such methodology would be to excavate two</P>
<P>      inches of soil at a time. As the soil is removed in two inch increments, findings can</P>
<P>      be carefully logged in a systematic fashion. The methods that are used should ideally</P>
<P>      best help answer the research questions. The research questions should address</P>
<P>      what aspect of the dig that the researcher wishes to be answered. For example, if</P>
<P>      stone axes are being excavated in a temple floor in Chichen, then a research</P>
<P>      question such as "What purpose did the stone axe play in the everyday life for the</P>
<P>      Chichen natives?" Another research question may seek to find patterns in</P>
<P>      architechtural design throughout MesoAmerica. "What are the the similarities</P>
<P>      between structures, and how did they occur?" might be an appropriate research</P>
<P>      question in this case. If a large area must be screened for potential dig sites, then</P>
<P>      site location is an important part of the archaeological process. Site location</P>
<P>      involves choosing one area over another. Such decisions could be made on such</P>
<P>      variables as proximity to water, elevation (for safety, and protection against invasion)</P>
<P>      , as well as by proximity to vegetation and animal life. These factors are all very</P>
<P>      important to daily life and could dictate whether or not a group of people would live in</P>
<P>      a particular area. Site location was an important factor in the crescent rockshelter.</P>
<P>      Dr. Mendoza was involved in a dig in an area that had previously been surveyed and</P>
<P>      deemed worthless. Site location was what let Dr. Mendoza find significant</P>
<P>      archaeological artifacts in the land while it offered nothing to previous excavators.</P>
<P>      Looking at soil samples (soil analysis) can help predict the likelihood of a significant</P>
<P>      finding, as well. Soil of a certain color can indicate human remains, bodily as well as</P>
<P>      garbolic. A soil sample can also serve as a type of dating system, to get, if nothing</P>
<P>      else, an approximate time period of the artifacts being excavated.</P>

<P>      1. David Hurst Thomas and his crew used several different methods in order to find</P>
<P>      mission Santa Catalina on the island of St. Catherines Island in Georgia. The first</P>
<P>      task that these archaeologists faced was the location of the mission. Vegetation had</P>
<P>      overtaken much of the island and had left no visible traces of the settlement above</P>
<P>      ground. The team used random transect sampling in its first attempt to find the site of</P>
<P>      the mission. This involved separating the island into 31 east to west transects, with</P>
<P>      members of the team walking a percentage of these imaginary lines looking for</P>
<P>      potential sites. This method reduced the search area to the area of 30 football fields,</P>
<P>      which was much more focused than the whole island, but much too large to be</P>
<P>      thoroughly excavated. In order to reduce the area of the site, the crew employed the</P>
<P>      use of a gasoline power auger, basically a machine that digs holes. Artifacts found in</P>
<P>      the soil piles left by the auger were mapped in order to let the archaeologists know</P>
<P>      where high concentrations of artifacts were hidden. Using this method, the potential</P>
<P>      dig site was reduced from 30 football fields to 3 acres. The great advantage of the</P>
<P>      auger was its ability to quickly dig holes and leave the piles of soil in easily</P>
<P>      searchable "doughnuts." The crew then began to utilize remote sensing in order to</P>
<P>      find the main structures of the mission. Since they expected to find "wattle-and-daub"</P>
<P>      style buildings, they used a proton precession magnometer. This device would be</P>
<P>      able to locate the iron found in mud daub plaster. A "magnetic contour map" of the</P>
<P>      site was created using the magnometer, which hinted at three particular areas within</P>
<P>      the site. When these areas where excavated, a well casing, domestic artifacts, and</P>
<P>      the "downed wall of a much larger mission building" were found. One tremendous</P>
<P>      advantage of using a magnometer is that no actual digging needs to be done. This</P>
<P>      can be an important technique for exploration in physically and politically sensitive</P>
<P>      areas. I think that the techniques and devices used by Thomas and his crew fulfilled</P>
<P>      his mission objectives beautifully. The Santa Catalina Mission digs also offers and</P>
<P>      example of how archaeological techniques have matured and changed in the past</P>
<P>      hundred years. 2. When Thomas and his crew first divided St. Catherines Island into</P>
<P>      31 transects; they were bringing the overgrowth into the 21st century. These</P>
<P>      horizontal imaginary lines that "transected (hence the name)" the island were used</P>
<P>      as a tool in order for the researchers to better conceptualize their research area. By</P>
<P>      dividing the island into smaller portions, they were able to delegate responsibility to</P>
<P>      different people for different areas of the island. They were also able to further</P>
<P>      reduce the island into more manageable work areas. These same rationalization of</P>
<P>      being able to conceptualize the research area are why archaeologists "dig square</P>
<P>      holes." Test pits tend to be one-meter squares that can descend into the ground for</P>
<P>      many feet. By making the pits square, researchers are able to add a third dimension</P>
<P>      to their findings, "front to back, side to side," and "top to bottom." This is an</P>
<P>      improvement over finding artifacts later by sifting in that one can see specifically</P>
<P>      where the objects were in relation to each other. These square pits are much more</P>
<P>      time consuming and generally more fruitful than the results that an auger can give, as</P>
<P>      they should be. Augers are used to locate the areas where square pits where</P>
<P>      excavation subsequently occurs. 3. In the words of Thomas, middle-range research</P>
<P>      is "linking archaeological data with the relevant aspects of human behavior that</P>
<P>      produced it." Ethnoarchaeology does this same thing by observing firsthand similar</P>
<P>      behaviors that are related in either content or outcome. Observed relationships can</P>
<P>      be applied to a historical context and attempt to explain confusing phenomenon.</P>
<P>      These frameworks based on facts (theories) can contribute to larger bodies of</P>
<P>      knowledge by providing scenarios to explain cultural events. Garbology focuses</P>
<P>      bodies of knowledge concerning living individuals by letting us see exactly what</P>
<P>      people do, versus what they SAY they are doing. Similarly, garbolic archaeology can</P>
<P>      let us know what was going on during a time period in the past. If nothing else, we</P>
<P>      can GUESS what was going on…or what continues to go on. Experimental</P>
<P>      archaeology reminds me of participant observation, in that a researcher participates</P>
<P>      in similar cultural activities as the subject of inquiry, and makes observations</P>
<P>      pertaining to those activities. Gaining insights into hunting mammoths by hunting</P>
<P>      elephants with similar equipment is one example of this. </P>

<P>      Our last class period met in building 110, located on the northwest corner of campus.</P>
<P>      In this small laboratory building, our archaeology class recieved our second</P>
<P>      introduction to flintknapping. After a short demonstration by Dr. Mendoza, we were</P>
<P>      able to make our first attempt at flintknapping. I started out with a fist sized shard of</P>
<P>      obsidian. I proceeded to strike the obsidian with a hammerstone of approximately</P>
<P>      the same size in an attempt to create some workable flakes. After I had flaked away</P>
<P>      the fist sized obsidian to the size of a walnut, I selected the thinnest, most even flake.</P>
<P>      I did this hoping that this flake would be most appropriate for a projectile tip; thin</P>
<P>      enough to be workable, sharp, and hopefully have some strength. At this point,</P>
<P>      realize that I was wearing leather gloves and a leather palm shield; a piece of leather</P>
<P>      with a hole for my thumb. Flaking as I did required percussion flaking, and now it was</P>
<P>      time to begin pressure flaking. For this job I used an antler point. Antlers are</P>
<P>      compressed hair, but can get a fairly sharp point on them. I would hold the shard in</P>
<P>      my leather glove/protector in my left hand, and hold the antler in my right. I set the</P>
<P>      point of the antler against the edge of the obsidian and applied pressure, both up</P>
<P>      and down, to the flake. This caused the flake to appear both thinner and serrated. My</P>
<P>      triangular shard of obsidian was now resembling an arrowhead, although it was</P>
<P>      much too thick to be a menace to a deer. After this crude tool began to appear, I</P>
<P>      attempted to add notches to the base of the point. I believe these notches were a</P>
<P>      feature of the arrowhead that allowed them to be easily attached to shafts. For this</P>
<P>      job I used an antler with a thin, blade like point to it. Unfortunately, my notches did not</P>
<P>      reach very far into the point because of its thickness. This is now I ended my</P>
<P>      flintknapping session, with a thick projectile point with shallow nothces in the base.</P>
<P>      All around my feet were shards and flakes of obsidian, a result of my classmates and</P>
<P>      I working with obsidian. I think that my piece was of very poor quality, but then again,</P>
<P>      it was my first attempt at flintknapping. I think that if my livelihood depended upon it, I</P>
<P>      would become very adept very quickly at fashioning stone tools.</P>
