<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;In small groups in which everyone feels that a great deal depends &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;upon his actions, and learns to act upon his own responsibility &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;instead of losing himself in the anonymity of the mass, social &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;patterns grow up in which individuality can almost certainly &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;develop.</P>

<P>&#9;The above statement is a reflection of the core values of communitarianism.  In this paper I will be describing the distinguishing characteristics of this theory and its application to specific social problems. I have chosen this social theory as the topic for my deliverable in order to educate myself on the subject of community in greater depth than discussed in class.  By becoming knowledgeable in this theory, I hope to synthesize my own definition of community from the literature written on this topic.  Additionally, I hoped to research a theory whose goal was the improvement of society through examination of individual behavior.  I will be trying to explain the communitarianism paradigm and how it could be used in today’s society.</P>
<P>&#9;The theory I will be using in this paper was developed by Amitai Etzioni in the 1980’s in response to his perception of the declining moral values of modern society.  Etzioni is the editor of a quarterly communitarian newspaper, <I>The Responsive Community</I> and is a university professor at George Washington University.  </P>
<P>&#9;Communitarianism maintains that society functions better when individuals accept a degree of personal responsibility.  Interpersonal bonds are seen as being in a state of decay and are the cause of many problems that plague today’s society.  Ultimately, the goal of this theory is to overcome modern social problems by strengthening communal relationships and the bonds between people.  It appears to me that this theory is more of a preventative than a corrective measure, that is, stopping the problem before it starts.  Educating and accountability are key concepts to this theory.   Collective concerns are given priority over individual matters, a factor that draws criticism from libertarian groups seeking to maximize personal freedoms.  Communitarians promote the view that the state is &quot;<I>more real</I> than the individual and the individual who does not fit in with the social norms or the law is <I>objectively irrational</I> (Ross, http://www.friesian.com/rights.htm#text-3).&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Education is central to this theory in that ideal sets of values beneficial to society are taught at an individual level.  Setting a good example for your children and teaching them the difference between right and wrong are central in their emotional development and their future behavior.  Accountability, or taking responsibility for your actions, is important in order to individualize the solution and not burden others with your problems.  Asking for something and giving nothing is a trait many people hold today that communitarianism seeks to abolish.  Participating in elections and serving jury duty are examples of civic duties with which communitarians would involve all members of today’s society.  Many people do not want to serve jury duty due to the complication it causes in their daily lives, but when you ask people if they should be entitled to a jury of their peers, they will undoubtedly say &quot;yes.&quot;   This line of thinking neglects the fact that without people serving on juries, there would be no such thing as a jury of one’s peers.  This aversion to civic duty is an example of unaccountability and the kind of behavior that communitarians seek to change. </P>
<P>&#9;The benefits to your community that result from your moral behavior are an important factor in this theory.  Communitarianism stresses your obligation to behave in a just and moral fashion.  Individual rights and social responsibilities are emphasized, as well strengthening of interpersonal relationships between members of a community.  This movement observes that the decline in moral attitudes and behaviors in contemporary society are the cause for many modern problems.</P>
<P>&#9;Individual responsibilities are required from individuals in exchange for individual rights.  This theory notes that individuals are eager to take whatever they are able to by whatever means available, and their reluctance to give anything back to their neighbors and local institutions.  A famous metaphor that describes a society of this nature is that of a bodybuilder with strong arms and upper body and puny legs.  The strong arms represent individuals perception of &quot;rights&quot;, and the weak legs are the individuals returns to society.  This unevenly balanced society does not function to the best of its capability because of the limitations that the weaker portion of the body sets on the stronger half.  &#9;Communitarianism seeks to solve social problems by instilling values and morality on the individual level.  Communitarians believe that individuals are born without morality and ethics, and that these behaviors must be learned.  The strengthening of the social institutions where people learn these values must occur if we are to combat social ills in an effective manner.  Family and schools are the first two institutions where values are learned by children.  The communitarian movement desires  to strengthen familial relationships and see to it that moral education is taught in schools.</P>
<P>&#9;Communitarians hold that the family is imperative to the development of appropriate values in children.  The responsibility of the parents is to provide a physically and mentally safe environment in order for the child to become a socially conscious and productive citizen.  Emotionally traumatizing events that can be detrimental to a child’s emotional health and their effects need to be minimized.  A communitarian outlook on divorce would hold that the parents need to stay together for the benefit of the children.  This aspect of communitarianism can be transformed into policy by giving the parents financial penalties if they were to divorce, as well as by giving the children financial priority in the event of a parental split.  Supervows, or commitments exceeding the legal minimums for marriage, can also decrease the likelihood of parental separation.  Making the parents accountable for raising their children in an appropriate manner is one way to strengthen interpersonal bonds which are conducive to a healthy society.</P>
<P>&#9;Moral education in schools is another topic that communitarianism addresses.  Schools are the second place, after families, where children internalize the values of others.    This theory holds that schools are obligated to teach not only academic materials but character education as well.   Educational institutions need to reinforce the values that are taught in the home.  For example, this can be done by emphasizing sportsmanship and the rules of a sport instead of the importance placed on winning.  Grades must be an accurate representation of a student’s achievement and not be influenced by other determinants. </P>
<P>&#9;Crime is another factor with which communitarians hold a controversial stance.  The restriction of certain freedoms in certain situations would be legal in a communitarian society, as the benefit of the society is placed above the freedom of the individual.   This type of behavior has been observed in the Detroit suburb of Inkster.  This community was host to a drug market that severely limited the lifestyles of its inhabitants.  Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano’s response to this drug problem was to establish checkpoints at the outskirts of this suburb that checked everyone entering for a valid drivers license and proof of insurance.  These checkpoints stopped 100 cars in a three hour period, eight of which where registered to residents of this neighborhood.  Forty-two citations were written, and a result of police presence, the drug dealers left the neighborhood.  Sheriff Ficano’s methods were subsequently brought into a lawsuit by the former mayor of Inkster who claimed that these checkpoints were classified as unreasonable search and seizure.  This case calls into question communitarian values which would favor searches presently called unconstitutional if effectively reduced crime and where applied for the ultimate benefit of society.</P>
<P>&#9;A traditional communitarian approach to rehabilitation would be to allow the public assist in the punishing of an individual criminal.  This policy has been implemented in Saratosa, Florida.  Here, convicted drunk drivers must place bumper stickers identifying themselves as such on their automobiles.  In another case, men in Lincoln County Oregon who are caught with prostitutes receive a lesser sentence if they allow their name to be published in the local newspaper.  These methods implement public humiliation as a way that communities can punish an individual. </P>
<P>&#9;Restriction of personal rights in favor of responsibilities is one concept that not everyone agrees with.   Criticism comes from organizations that fear communitarianism is a white male majority movement consisting of feel-good rhetoric that plays on fears and lacks new ideas.   Critics cite Japanese internment camps during World War II and the Red Scare of the 1950’s as a community’s response to perceived threats.  </P>
<P>&#9;Communitarianism sees the advancement and strengthening of communities as a solution to social problems.  Sometimes this strength is shown in sacrificing individual rights in order for the whole to function in a more organized fashion.  This concept is what makes communitarianism stand out from other social theories.   This particular point is the deciding factor in whether or not social scientists accept this theory as valid.  If communitarianism is to become widely accepted, it must overcome the challenge of strengthening communities without compromising people’s rights.   </P>
