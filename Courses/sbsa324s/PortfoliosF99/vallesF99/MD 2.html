<b><font color="#000000">INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">As this research was underway, a question arose
and followed me throughout.&nbsp; What was life like for the Indigenous
before the Missionaries arrived in central Monterey?</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Life was shaped in a totally different manner
before the 1700's when exposure to the Spanish occurred.&nbsp; I will discuss
in a more thorough manner what the Native American perspective was like,
and how they viewed the encounter and what was going on during the tome
of the cultural genocide of their people.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Just as well, I will touch upon the Missionary's
perspective on the "enlightening" of their arrival.&nbsp; What they felt
they were doing, as opposed to what they actually did.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">I will discuss a period in time when nature and
familism were the core of a society and what levels of organization existed,
how it deteriorated though time and what the Missionary's role in that
was.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">I will elaborate on what life like was, making
the traditional and established tribes such as Esselen and Salinan my focus,
and San Juan Bautista my focal mission.&nbsp; I am making those tribes
my focal tribes for the purpose of linking the Indians who would have inhabited
San Juan Bautista.&nbsp; I want to bring this research paper to a more
personal and local level, and tying it to San Juan Bautista for purposes
of tying it to the archaeological excavations, I have participated in at
that particular mission.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">I want, through this research paper, uncover
how what one perspective on a particular action can have drastic unexpected
and unintentional results.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">THESIS</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">Economics and the push of religion were the main
forces behind the colonization of the Native Indigenous people in Alta.
California.&nbsp; The result was a colonization of mind, body and spirit.&nbsp;
The ultimate result was genocide.&nbsp; What I hope to discuss is the life
before Spanish Inquisition for the Native Indians, the intentions of the
Franciscan Priests and what the goal of establishing missions was.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">In addition, I will include how the existence
of missions resulted in acculturation.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">REVIEW OF LITERATURE</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">What I have found through the literature I have
used for my research has been the concept of consistancy when applied to
the exposure of missions upon the Indians.&nbsp; Consistancy because many
times the reasoning behind the establishment of missions was for the spread
of Christianity which came hand in hand with civilizing.&nbsp; One of the
most disturbing quotes that I came to upon completing my research was one
discussing the awareness of acculturation that the Franciscan Priests carried
with them.&nbsp; They were concious of the impact they were going to have
on the Indians, and if anything that was the goal, to destruct and eliminate
the existance of a society and the beliefs they carried, simply because
they felt that what they carried as a society was the right way.&nbsp;
They felt it was the beliefs any civilized and educated people should believe
in their God, without considering how much they would change and destroy
on their quest for "saving savages."&nbsp; One of the primary objecties
of the Franciscan directed mission programs in Alta. California was the
transformation of the culture and world view of the Indian converts congregated
in the missions</font></blockquote>
