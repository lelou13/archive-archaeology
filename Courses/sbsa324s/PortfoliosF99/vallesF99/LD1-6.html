<b>Lab Deliverable 1</b>
<p>1. Use the transparency and its alphanumeric grid to select ten grid
units at random from the map of Xochicalco.&nbsp; This selection is strictly
random and can be based on any logic or random order that you choose.
<p>I chose a couple of areas that were on a very high mountaintop.&nbsp;
I did so based on the fact that war was common and the possibility for
a migration to a location difficult to reach was probable.&nbsp; My choices
were: G7, K3, L4, I6, J13, T2, A7, C9, W3, and H8.
<p>2. Select five transect columns or rows at random.
<br>The areas I selected were on rows: C, T, U and columns 9 and 10.3.&nbsp;
I chose these based on my predicted settlement, that would explain why
I chose them low and near water sources.&nbsp; These would fulfill the
human need for water and surrounding resources existent in areas near water
–both ocean and river that runs through Xochicalco.
<p>3. Select ten units on the basis of where you would expect to find habitation
or settlement in the area of the map given such considerations as the presence
of water, topography, defense, etc.
<br>The choices I made were: E6, F6, K3, L3, T2, U2, V2, A9, B9 and C9.4.&nbsp;
I suspected these areas would not be near any kind of noise or would factor
noise out.
<p>4. Finally, select five units on the basis of a stratified sampling
that excludes steep cliffs and those areas not specifically included within
the topographically -mapped portions of the Xochicalco mapping.&nbsp; You
may also exclude hills and gorges and or valleys if you wish.
<br>D11, E11, F9, G11, and F8 were the units I selected.&nbsp; They were
chosen based on my knowledge of topographic maps that it was a plain, flat
and nearly deserted area.</blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>“Myths and Moundbuilders” (Odessey, 1988)</b>
<p>1. Identify the primary “myths” of archaeology and the moundbuilders
as noted in the video commentary.&nbsp; Having first identified the principal
myths noted, please discuss what you feel serves to explain the origins
of the myths in question?
<p>Myths of archaeology: archaeology has been in the past biased hypothesis,
where the archaeologist has from his/her point of view molded what he/she
has come across into what he wants it to present. The responsible parties
for the mounds were not given immediate credit for their creations and
as a result stories were created to explain what occurred. In some aspects
this causes much doubt and questioning as to what other "stories" have
been created about what we have been taught.
<p>2. What value would you ascribe to the “mound reconstruction” experiment
undertaken by the archaeologist portrayed in the video?&nbsp; Why was the
experiment important, and what did the experiment seek to demonstrate?
<p>Although this activity disrupts the ground which should be more carefully
excavated, it does bring more insight as to how the Natives created the
mounds, how long it would take, what type of society they lived in, and
perhaps more insight as to why they may have been created. The explanation
given, as to who was buried in the mounds brings questions to me.&nbsp;
It stated in the video that archaeologists concluded people who created
the mounds were sometimes buried in the mounds with the person it was created
for.&nbsp; My question is, is it possible that instead of it being the
people that created the mounds who was buried -that it was the family?
<p>3. Reflect on the value of the approach represented by the so-called
“salvage archaeology” approach portrayed by the video.&nbsp; Please bare
in mind that several of the archaeology projects depicted in the video
were undertaken so as to “salvage” the remains of the sites under threat
of destruction by development or public works projects.&nbsp; Based on
what you observed, and indicated in your notes, what is “salvage archaeology”
and how is it beneficial (and or destructive) to the interpretation of
the prehistory of North America?
<p>“Salvage archaeology” was and I believe continues to occur so as to
conserve sites from destruction through development, and I believe this
is a positive practice. I strongly believe these areas need to be conserved
and protected so that we can further study who, what, when, where, and
why more into depth. I believe that there continues to be room for more
learning even on things that are believed to be understood. I don't believe
we should ever allow these sites to interrupted much less destroyed. The
video brought more questions to mind, is there any further explanation
to tuberculosis other than maiz? It's difficult for me to believe that
as a result to maiz and more people around-TB came to be. I would think
TB was an alien disease/infection that may have been brought in some other
way. Perhaps a passer-by? I would be interested to hear the perspective
of the Native American more in depth.
<p><b>Lab Deliverable 3</b>
<p>1. In this first instance, you will break unto groups and examine the
facsimile copy of the ancient Mexican screen-fold “codex” brought to lab
by your professor.&nbsp; In examining the “codex” in question, you are
to interpret the following:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. First, identify and describe the primary function
and overall format of the codex in question.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Second, provide an interpretation of how you
believe the manuscript in question was interpreted and “read.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Third, identify the primary theme of that section
of the manuscript that you and your group have chosen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Select at least a half dozen items of material
culture and describe them as a group of “related” items.
<p>The six things I chose from the codex Vindobenensis were the facial
paintings, the different circles connected with the animal next to the
person-some are blank circles/some have a circle inside, the different
significance’s of the animal, the meaning of the painting of the body in
black, the headdresses, and the women’s role as shown in codex. 1. The
facial painting could represent what their jobs were in a battle, who they
were in society as far as status and possibly what they have gone through.
2. The paintings usually seem to have a person with an animal next to them
and connected to the animal is a series of circles and I noticed that some
of the circles were blank and some were filled with a smaller circle in
the center. The significance could be what the animal represents, what
gender the individual is, where they are from, whether the person is from
high-class status or it could be simply a variety in the same thing. 3.
The significance of the animal seems to vary; it appears that the animal
could be either a zodiac, or name or personality traits. 4. Painting of
the body in black could represent courage besides death and evil. Black
is a strong color and I believe there is possibility that the color is
something significant, maybe not as significant as the color red but also
very important. 5. The headdresses are very elaborate on some and non-existent
on others, it's usually on the elaborately dresses causing me to believe
the reason for the elaborate features is a signal of status and wealth.
6. The role of women as I saw it in the codex was confusing. It was slightly
difficult to tell the men from the women apart most of the time unless
they were servants and they were nude.
<p>2. The second exercise in this lab entails creating a technical description
for the artifacts provided by your professor.&nbsp; You are to provide
a technical description that includes the “Who, What, Where, When, and
How” of the item in question.&nbsp; In this instance, you should interpret
this to mean the “size, shape, color, composition, function and origins”
of the artifact in question.&nbsp; Use that terminology that you believe
to be appropriate in this instance.
<br>The three items found-a chert core for flaking stone tools, Spanish
colonial trade bead-(red glass), and the Bovine tooth can all be evidence
of natives occupying that habitat, what they ate, what was used for trade,
who they traded with,and the manner in which they killed or prepared their
food. It can tell us that as far as a culture they traded with Spanish,
or lived among Spanish. It tells us they were skilled and advanced as far
as hunting and weapon making.

<p><b>Lab Deliverable 5</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1. What tools and procedures did David Hurst Thomas and his crew employ
in the quest for the “Lost Spanish Mission”?&nbsp; What were the advantages
and disadvantages of the techniques and procedures employed?&nbsp; Were
the methods employed successful (as per original objectives) in the long
run?
<p>David Hurst and the crew he lead used a variety of archaeological methods
to uncover the long lost Franciscan mission, Santa Catalina.&nbsp; The
area Hurst worked with was “virtually uninhabited” so he had to come up
with methods that could cover large areas, and give him more turnouts.
<br>In order to do so he began with systematic, random transect sampling.&nbsp;
The team walked series of 31 east west transects, each transect was 100
meters wide.&nbsp; Through the transect sampling strategy Hurst and his
team were able examine 20% of St., Catherines Island.&nbsp; The investigated
each site with two ore more1 meter square test units, resulting in approximately
400 test pits.
<br>Taking into consideration the area they were surveying and it’s size,
they needed a faster method.&nbsp; Hurst moved on to using a gasoline powered
posthole digger, a power auger, and excavated many, many round holes.&nbsp;
He moved to this method because with is, two people can dig a 3 foot deep
hole in less than one minute.&nbsp; After they had sufficiently digged,
they created simple dot-density maps.&nbsp; With the assistance of computer
programs, they easily began a data conversion process.&nbsp; With the power
auger they were allowed to work with 100 by 100 meter square overall sampling
grid of the island.
<p>After being not being very lucky –but suspecting that they were on to
something, they used a technique that would be a little more deeply than
the surface.&nbsp; They moved on to remote sensoring, a proton precession
magnetometer.&nbsp; They had come to the conclusion that the buildings
they were trying to locate were made by a wattle and daub technique.&nbsp;
Because that was the case, they were aware that it be biodegradable, but
what that lead to was the ability to pinpoint every magnetically attractive
piece.&nbsp; The daub plaster contains microscopic iron particles that
were located by the sensor.&nbsp; The way that they work is they measure
the strength of magnetism between the earth’s magnetic core and a sensor
held by the archaeologist.&nbsp; When hundreds of the readings were taken
across a systematic grid, a computer plotter can generate a magnetic contour
map reflecting the shape, and the intensity of the magnetic anomalies under
the ground surface.&nbsp; With the use of the magnometer readings and the
help from Ervan Garrison along with a magnometer team from Texas A&amp;M
University they began to dig, and dig some more.&nbsp; They did the digging
where the magnometer team recommended, and after a lot of hard work they
hit a well… and success, they had come across Mission Santa Catalina (Hurst
Thomas 1999. 126-134).
<p>The advantages of the procedures used by Hurst and his team, were in
his own words, drew on today’s technological arsenal, which includes dozens
of noninvasive, nondestructive techniques.&nbsp; It also allowed them to
gather archaeological data even before they excavated any objects, features
and buildings.&nbsp; I believe the methods implemented and procedures followed,
were very successful.&nbsp; The only technique I would have to question
would be the gas power auger.&nbsp; It probably destroyed as it dug because
it’s so strong and fast.&nbsp; The goal was to find Mission Santa Catalina,
they methods worked, so as per the original objectives they succeed in
what they aimed for.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2.&nbsp; According to David Hurst Thomas, Middle Range Research permits
archaeologists to generate “the knowledge necessary to relate the world
of archaeological facts to the world of general behavioral theory” (Hurst
Thomas, 1999: 161).&nbsp; Given this characterization of Middle Range Research
in archaeology, identify and describe how it is that Ethnoarchaeology,
Garbology (Modern Material Culture studies), and Experimental Archaeology
all ultimately contribute to that larger body of knowledge that constitutes
Middle Range Research and its findings.
<p>Ethnoarchaeologists study living, observing artifacts, features, and
residues while they still exist in their systematic contexts.&nbsp; These
studies have examined, among other things, the mechanisms of the artifact
curation and reuse, and the social correlates of stone tool manufacture
and use (Hurst Thomas, 1999:182).&nbsp; Ethnoarchaeology is one of the
very important factors to put together the puzzle of who the peoples were
that inhabited the land that the archaeologists is uncovering.&nbsp; The
Ethnoachaeologist can come up with reasoning as to why they used X particular
material, who created it or what the significance behind it’s creation
was-based on cultures of the present day.&nbsp; They can determine what
cultures were based on the archaeological findings (Hurst 161-178).
<p>Ethnoarchaeology is one aspect of the Middle Range Research, but another
is Garbology, Modern Material Culture studies.&nbsp; Garbology applies
archaeological methods to the analysis and description of modern societies.&nbsp;
It is nonreactive, people aren’t aware someone will be looking through
their garbage-so they can’t alter what they through away.&nbsp; These projects
can be used to accumulate data and study current social issues.&nbsp; They
also attempt to compare modern food discard behavior with past trends.&nbsp;
It is evidence that has no comparison because it is so raw and true.&nbsp;
In Garbology, there are two basic goals, discovering the relation between
remains of waste to the behavior that produced them (the methodological
objective).&nbsp; And, to find a workable explanation of specific and recurrent
patterns that are observed in the archaeological records (the substantive
objective) (Hurst 168-178).
<p>Experimental Archaeology is yet another key bridging study.&nbsp; It
attempts to derive relevant processes by means of experimental replication.&nbsp;
An Experimental Archaeologist comes away from the experience understanding
several things not evident from simply studying archaeological remains.&nbsp;
It provides an actual demonstration of the events or procedures of whatever
is the study, whether it’s a hunt or some craft.&nbsp; It is actually made
or done, demonstrating the given technique could have been used in the
past – that it wasn’t impossible (Hurst 175-182).
<br>In conclusion, Middle range research links our ideas about the world
to the world itself and gives meaning to out empirical observations.&nbsp;
It dictates the way we perceive the past, and with combinations of Ethnoarchaeology,
Garbology, and Experimental – a better conclusion and reasoning can be
made about what the past consisted of and who lived it (Hurst 182).</blockquote>
