<P><B>1- Map Sampling<BR>
</B>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Mapping Sampling <BR>
Date: 9/1/99.- Time: 12:21:59 AM.- Entry Num: 74<BR>
In this exercise I took in to consideration the largest portions
of flat land that was located near a water source and on high
ground which would serve in battles. 1)In step one I choose the
grid squares L 8-9-10,M 8-9-10, N 7-8-9-10. 2)I choose the transects
based on what each line passed through and what ones covered most
of my 10 selected grid squares in step 1. The transects I selected
were 9,10,11,12,13, and N. 3)When it came down to selecting ten
squares based on where I thought a settlement would have been<BR>
located I selected K 12-13, L 8-9-10, M 9-10, and N 8-9-10. 4)
Out of those ten grids I selected the five that I felt would be
the most logic ones to have the most evidence on them. I took
into consideration the location, the size, and how the location
would have serves as a protection over time. The squares I selected
were K13, L 9-10, and N 8-9.</P>

<P><B>2- Video Review<BR>
</B>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: LD: Divine Mission Video
<BR>
Date: 11/3/99.- Time: 12:49:15 AM.- Entry Num: 85<BR>
I think this video shows the time and money that goes into the
restoration of historical buildings and sites. I do think it is
important to restore these locations because it tells the history
of cultures and people. We can learn so much from our ancestors
and what they have done; we learn what is important to people
of the past and possibly what should be important to people of
today. The Divine Mission Video did show the relationship that
also develops between the workers and their location. Overall
the video was good in showing the restoration process, however
it did not keep my attention and that is not a good thing.</P>

<P><B>3- Material Culture<BR>
</B>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Material Culture 1 <BR>
Date: 9/7/99.- Time: 11:41:27 PM.- Entry Num: 145<BR>
I would assume these objects tell a lot about this specific archaeology
sight. The three items that were found at the Old Mission sight
this pass Friday were a) Chert core for flaking stone tools b)Spanish
colonial trade bead and c) Bovine tooth. -I would gather that
the chert core tells you that either stone tools were made here
or nearby and this shows that these people were into technology
or at least trying to get things done more efficient. -The Spanish
colonial trade bead would be evidence that some trading went on
at the mission. Being found near tools maybe there was trading
going on for the tools. -The Bovine tooth I think would be evidence
that within the Mission there were animals being kept and that
the people did eat meat of some kind. The three objects can tell
a lot about the activities, people and nutrition within the Mission
walls.</P>

<P><B>4- Excavation Methods<BR>
</B>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: LD4 Definitions <BR>
Date: 9/24/99.- Time: 12:00:31 AM.- Entry Num: 242<BR>
- Sampling Strategy: Sampling various small units within a larger
unit and excavating it to determine whether it is worth the time,
money and effort to excavate the larger unit. -Transect or pedestrian
surveys:Walking straight lines to find surface evidence of habitation.
- Soil analysis: Taking a soil sample and analyzing the composition
of it determining if there was human habitation there. - Datum:
A fixed reference point for the excavation making it easier to
map and giving people the same point of perspective. - Site grid:
Starting from the datum point, archaeologist stake and lines full
squares, and makes the grid permanent.</P>

<P><B>5- Reading Reviews<BR>

1) David Hurst Thomas and his crew used many different methods
and tools when trying to find the &quot;Lost Spanish Mission.&quot;
During the and dig the crew used transect sampling strategy, test
pits, gasoline powered post hole diggers, remote sensing, and
proton precision magnemeter. The advantage to these techniques
was that as little as possible damage was done to the environment
of the island and the disadvantage would probably have been the
cost of these methods. The methods employed were successful they
found the lost mission and preserved the island. 3) Middle Range
Research is basically the bringing together of both low and high
end archaeology; archaeologist do the observations, basic field
work, and the overarching research.The three mentioned types of
archaeology led to the larger body of Middle Range Research because
they study the habits of modern society and culture to base their
theories of the cultures of yesterday. 4) The scientific method
is basically: Issue, Hypothesis, Testing, Conclusion. This method
is used in archaeology in many ways, if an archaeologist is trying
to find a sight they would hypothesis on its locations based on
the environment, they then would test sites in search of an exact
location, and finally they would conclude it was their or not.
If an archaeologist discovers an artifact they can hypothesis
about its origin and use, they then can test it based on it make,
material, and what not they could conclude what its purpose is.</P>

<P><B>6- Stone Tool Analysis or Other<BR>
</B>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: LD: Restoration <BR>
Date: 11/3/99.- Time: 12:54:56 AM.- Entry Num: 91<BR>
Given the choice between restoring a building to its original
form or leaving as it is today, what would you do? I think I would
restore the building. I would want to document what each period
had done to the location to make it fit their needs or thoughts
but most of all I would want to see the building in all its original
glory no matter what that would be. I think if I were to restore
the building I would want to put together an exhibit of some sort
of all changes made during each time period. By doing this everyone
could see the changes throughout time and yet they could also
see the structure in its original form. So yes I would restore
the building but not without some record of its changes.<IMG
