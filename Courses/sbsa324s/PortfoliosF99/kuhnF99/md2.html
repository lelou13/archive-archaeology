<P>Garbology- The study of people and cultures through their rubbish.</P>

<P>Test Subject: One male college student and one female college
student.</P>

<P>Questions: -How well do we know our own habits?<BR>
- What are the habits of a &quot;normal&quot; college male/female?<BR>
- Do we base our hypothesis on stereotypes?<BR>
- Where did we get those stereotypes types?<BR>
- How does our first conclusion differ from our end conclusion?</P>

<P>Hypothesis: I feel the average male college student will drink
more and possibly do more drugs. I also believe the male to have
bad eating habits, compared to the female, that include: caffeine,
sugars, and other foods high in fats. I would think the female
student would be more aware of the food she eats. I also believe
that the female is going to possibly recycle more and do more
to protect the environment.</P>

<P>Experiments/Observations: <BR>
- Primary questioning of test subjects.<BR>
- Two week study of subjects waste.<BR>
- Comparison and conclusion.<BR>
- Final questioning of test subjects.</P>

<P>Conclusion: Well this all depends on outcomes and findings.<IMG
