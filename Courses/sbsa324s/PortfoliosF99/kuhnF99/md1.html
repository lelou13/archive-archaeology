<P>1.First, state your purpose for enrolling in this class.Having
stated said purpose, please comment on the extent to which you
feel your objectives for taking this course have been met or not
met. <BR>
- I wanted to learn about past cultures and find out more about
this field of work. I feel I have learned a lot from the instructor
about past cultures; however in order to learn more about this
field of work, I think I will have to experience it first hand
which will hopefully come with the project we have to do.</P>

<P>2.Comment on your participation in Lab and Field Deliverables.
Have you attended all class meetings and participated in all Lab
and Field Deliverables conducted to date? To what extent have
you actually involved and committed yourself to the completion
of Lab and Field deliverables? <BR>
- I have missed three days of class because I have been ill. Unfortunately
two of the days I did miss were field days and I can not make
those up. I tried to commit myself to this class and get involved
but it is hard with my other classes, work, and school involvement.
However, I have full intent of being able to spend more time on
this class after fall break.</P>

<P>3.How effectively have you used the Online Journal? Do you
feel that your comments within the Online Journal adequately reflect
the areas of study undertaken by each of the Deliverables in question?
Are you satisfied with your responses to questions and comments
posted to the Online Journal? <BR>
- Honestly, I don't really care for the online journal. I don't
like putting all my thoughts into the computer I would rather
do it by hand in a notebook that we could turn in at the end of
the semester. I know for sure my journal entries don't represent
each deliverable adequately because for the most part I feel rushed
or I don't like typing on the computer everything that I think
of. I am not satisfied with my responses in the journal however
I can not change them now, which is why I would prefer the historical
paper and pen method better.</P>

<P>4.How are you progressing with the topic of study that you
will use to prepare your final project report? [Disregard if you
have chosen the Field Option of excavation over the writing of
a final term project]. If you have chosen the Field Option, please
comment on what you feel that you have learned from your work
at the field site. <BR>
- I believe I have chosen along with another member of my class
Garbology. We have begun to do some internet search for this topic
however we have had little luck. I am growing nervous about the
paper and project as a whole because I do not know what the assignment
is for sure and we don't have to long left in the semester.</P>

<P>5.Please state in the most concise way possible, what it is
that you intend to do in the way of a final project report. For
those choosing the Lab Option, you should state whether or not
you intend to use the Lithics Lab or the Garbology Lab as the
subject matter of your final report. For those choosing a library
research paper, please provide at least four of the primary references
that you intend to use in the completion of your final project
paper. <BR>
- As I mentioned before I don't understand this assignment very
well or what is expected. I have chosen to do Garbology however,
we have not been instructed on how to go about this. I would like
to chose a person to interview do an initial interview and question
their life and possible habits. I then would like to do a two
week search of their garbage and record what I find and what it
tells me about that person. I would then like to interview the
person again and ask them about my findings.</P>

<P>6.What key concepts and areas of study engaged from within
the Lab and Field Deliverables have been of most interest to you?
How will such concepts and areas of study be reflected or not
reflected in your intended class project? <BR>
- The field or labs that have been of the most interesting to
me are the lectures about findings from ancient cultures. I also
was very intrigued by the discussion of the garbology search done
on the I believe it was the art on HCOM department here at CSUMB.
This will help me in my project because it has given me some basic
idea of what to do.</P>

<P>7.Please comment on which Lab and Field Deliverables you enjoyed
most...and which you enjoyed least. Please provide recommendations
on how you might improve on the content and type of Lab and Field
Deliverables offered in this section. What might you like to see
added in the way of Lab and or Field Deliverables? <BR>
- I have enjoyed most of the classes and labs. Sometimes the lectures
can get long and I get distracted. I really find it hard sitting
in front of a computer because it can be a distraction. I think
is class would be best taught in a more traditional setting one
day and in front of the computer or on site for labs the next
day. I would also think it better to have the option of turning
papers, drawing, journals, or whatever by hand rather then on
the computer.</P>

<P>8.How do you plan on improving upon your performance through
the duration of this semester? Please identify those areas that
you feel require improvement. Finally, please identify what you
see to be your primary strengths with respect to Lab and Field
Deliverables completed to date. <BR>
- I get things done and turn them in that is my strength in this
class. However, it can be hard to follow the syllabus at times
so I often don't know what is going on. I plan on going to every
class for the rest of the semester and not easily getting distracted
which can be hard.</P>

<P>NOTE: I really like the subject of this class and the instructor
who has so much information to offer. However, I find it hard
to follow the class sometimes, my interesting is not being kept,
and I don't like seeing everything on the computer.<IMG SRC="images/r75.gif"
