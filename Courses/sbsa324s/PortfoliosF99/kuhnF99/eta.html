Itis not every class where one of your projects is to collect garbageand sort through it and analyze my findings. Archaeology has beenone of the more unique classes I have taken but this is not altogetherbad. I enrolled in this class mainly because it sounded interestingand it covered one of my ULRs. Besides from academics  it soundedinteresting and was something I wanted to learn about. I thinkI have meet all of my objectives for taking this class. I havelearned about something I was interested in while working on reachingmy educational goals.<BR></P><P>As you may already know I have been fighting illnesses thissemester, so my attendance has been poor.  I attended all butthree class lectures and three field days I believe. I believeI have attempted to get involved in this class and at the leasthave gotten very attached to my garbage, I meant Garbology project.<BR></P><P>I believe the online journal to be more of a hassle than anythingelse. I am one who prefers to see my thoughts on paper, in myown format, and only view able by who I choose. I don't thinkmy journal entries are not the best way to assess myself and noI am not satisfied with my responses.<BR></P><P>My final project should be rather interesting because it isbased on garbage. I think I am progressing quite well now thatI have retrieved my garbage from Mendoza. I have been able tolearn some interesting habits of my subjects and have proven orat least found evidence to support some college stereotypes.<BR></P><P>I plan to present my Garbology findings in a power point presentationand bring in a few samples. My final paper will also include contentlists and comparison graphs. I hope to show fellow class matesjust how unconscious we are of our own habits.<BR></P><P>I think the most interesting thing I have studied is my fellowpeers habits through garbage. The flintnapping and stone toolexercises did not really spark my interest. As far as deliverablesare concerned I don't think any of them were really fun. The labdeliverables and journals were mixed and often left me confused.I would like to see a more understandable and clear syllabus anddirections. I would also suggest more options than stone toolsand Garbology for field days or labs.<BR></P><P>Well the semester is almost  over so we do not have much timeto improve, however, &quot;if I could take back time&quot; I wouldnot have missed so much class but that is out of my hands. I thinkmy main strength is simply getting things done. I have enjoyedthis class and have loved working with garbage, and my roommateenjoyed and now misses the lovely smell from the garbage beingin our bathroom.<BR></P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/r75.gif" WIDTH="583" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN="BOTTOM"BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="content.html"><IMG SRC="images/50.gif" WIDTH="36"HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><AHREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="images/51.gif" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="36"ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
