From what has been explained to the class today maps play an important
role in Archaeology. Maps allow archaeologist to rediscover sites
later and allows them to record all findings down to specific
locations. I think the only comment or question that I have is
that this is a lot of information to take in at one siting. I
hope to be able to recall this all later, however I think I may
have to review it for a several times before it is all understood
or comprehendible.</P>

In this exercise I took in to consideration the largest portions
of flat land that was located near a water source and on high
ground which would serve in battles. 1)In step one I choose the
grid squares L 8-9-10,M 8-9-10, N 7-8-9-10. 2)I choose the transects
based on what each line passed through and what ones covered most
of my 10 selected grid squares in step 1. The transects I selected
were 9,10,11,12,13, and N. 3)When it came down to selecting ten
squares based on where I thought a settlement would have been<BR>
located I selected K 12-13, L 8-9-10, M 9-10, and N 8-9-10. 4)
Out of those ten grids I selected the five that I felt would be
the most logic ones to have the most evidence on them. I took
into consideration the location, the size, and how the location
would have serves as a protection over time. The squares I selected
were K13, L 9-10, and N 8-9.</P>

I was close in many cases however most of my selected grid squares
resided in the highest points rather then lower terrain. I did
select one square that actually lied within the settlement. In
step one I selected L 8-9-10, M 9-10, and N 7-8-9-10 so I did
select three of the square grids that have settlements on them.
(N 8-9-10) In step two I selected the transects 9,10,12,13 and
N. With this step I would have found settlements with N, 9, and
10. With step three I did select two squares that have settlement
in them. (N 9-10) In step four I was left with only one selected
grid that would have had a settlement in and this would be N-9.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Video Review 1 <BR>
Date: 9/3/99.- Time: 1:06:47 AM.- Entry Num:117<BR>
I believe I have seen this video before in a history class possibly
in high school.I think in archaeology just like in any field the
workers going in with biases and assumptions. This video showed
how races Americans or early settlers were. For the most part
the early archeologist who excavated the mounds in North America
were looking for ways to disconnect the Indians with these sights
and with this goal they created myths of superior white men who
built these sights and other stories to take away credit from
Indians. The mound reconstruction was important because it will
give the archaeologist information and evidence to better understand
the mounds from history. I would describe this experiment as a
valuable tool to better understand the mounds. Salvage archaeology
is when archaeology teams go in and excavate a sight under time
constraints and other pressures of modern day in order to uncover
some information or artifacts of historical and cultural importance.
I think salvage archaeology can cause us as a society to lose
very valuable information however due to the modern world it may
be the only way to save some artifacts before road ways or buildings
take over.</P>

I would assume these objects tell a lot about this specific archaeology
sight. The three items that were found at the Old Mission sight
this pass Friday were a) Chert core for flaking stone tools b)Spanish
colonial trade bead and c) Bovine tooth. -I would gather that
the chert core tells you that either stone tools were made here
or nearby and this shows that these people were into technology
or at least trying to get things done more efficient. -The Spanish
colonial trade bead would be evidence that some trading went on
at the mission. Being found near tools maybe there was trading
going on for the tools. -The Bovine tooth I think would be evidence
that within the Mission there were animals being kept and that
the people did eat meat of some kind. The three objects can tell
a lot about the activities, people and nutrition within the Mission
walls.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Material culture 2 <BR>
Date: 9/9/99.- Time: 11:39:46 PM.- Entry Num: 175<BR>
The six pictures that I picked were: 1) Man with a hawk head:
which I believe symbolized a man of high status or related to
the church since the hawk represented the heavens in this culture;
2) Man in a jaguar suit: which I think represents a warrior or
high status lord of some kind; 3) A compass looking picture: I
think this picture probably represents the compass and the directions
which played an important role in this culture; 4) A building
structure with a man inside: This picture looks like some sort
a burial of a man which leads me to believe there were probably
deaths during this time or a sacrifice; 5) Corn rows with a man:
I think this picture must represent the importance of corn for
these people however I do not know what the man must represent;
and 6) An A looking picture: this design with an A looking letter
encircled with a box. I don't know exactly what it represents
but I think maybe it represents the name of the people or something
along those lines.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Material Artifacts 3 <BR>
Date: 9/10/99.- Time: 12:38:50 AM.- Entry Num: 185<BR>
The two artifacts that I received were very similar yet little
variations placed their origins in completely different locations.
ARTIFACT 1: Artifacts number 1.09 is tan in coloring and the flaking
appears to be going in a downward direction. When compared to
the hand out it resembles the Eastgate Series-Eastgate Expangind-stem
and the location or origin is unknown. ARTIFACT 2: Artifact 4.31
is black in color and the flaking appears to be randomly inflicted
upon the stone. This artifact resembles the Terminal Paleo-Indian/Archaic
Elko-Bitterroot Series (10,000-500BP) which originated from Hogup
Cave (UT). The two piece are similar in their cut however color,
size, and flaking patterns.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Material Culture 4 <BR>
Date: 9/15/99.- Time: 12:14:19 AM.- Entry Num: 199<BR>
Journal Entry: I received artifact 3.05 from what I could gather
it is similar to the late plains prehistoric-early plains arrow
heads/tool. It is a small triangle and could possibly originate
from IVB Wedding of the Water Caves. The color of this artifact
is a white hue 5Y 8/1.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Material Culture 5 <BR>
Date: 9/15/99.- Time: 1:07:56 AM.- Entry Num: 211<BR>
Artifact 3.05: Both side a and b are interior and show no cortex.
The proximal edge is flat showing no curves and the distal end
has a sharp point. The flaking appears to have been done on both
side a and b and the artifact has no present ridge.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Chichen <BR>
Date: 9/22/99.- Time: 12:47:26 AM.- Entry Num: 227<BR>
Chichen Itza is a very interesting city because of its diversity
and I can understand why Archaeologist have been confused and
mystified by it. I would assume that before the Explanatory Period
people could not understand or grasp the concept of a mixed culture,
that is educated and civilized. However, from my understanding
that explains the people of Chichen Itza quiet well. They had
their religion, which played a large role in their life, beliefs,
and architecture. They studied the heavens and understood the
concept of stars, moon, and calendars. Their architecture also
shows that they were a diverse group that brought in ideas from
other cities. This city was not simply ruled by priest and occupied
by peasants they had a more to their culture and civilization.</P>

- Sampling Strategy: Sampling various small units within a larger
unit and excavating it to determine whether it is worth the time,
money and effort to excavate the larger unit. -Transect or pedestrian
surveys:Walking straight lines to find surface evidence of habitation.
- Soil analysis: Taking a soil sample and analyzing the composition
of it determining if there was human habitation there. - Datum:
A fixed reference point for the excavation making it easier to
map and giving people the same point of perspective. - Site grid:
Starting from the datum point, archaeologist stake and lines full
squares, and makes the grid permanent.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Flintknapping Video <BR>
Date: 9/29/99.- Time: 12:23:51 AM.- Entry Num: 256<BR>
Many believe that the people from ten thousand years ago were
not as intelligent as the people of modern society or at least
this is the way I thought; however, a culture that can develop
a tool with their own hands and some simple tools is far more
advanced then the machines of today. It is very eye opening to
know that this culture reused and reshaped the one tool to do
any kind of work they need to be done on a hunt, which is very
unlike or society where we have one tool for every job and when
we are done with it we throw it away. The tool makers also know
the physics in making and shaping each tool they needed which
from this video I can imagine is not an easy thing to grasp.</P>

1) David Hurst Thomas and his crew used many different methods
and tools when trying to find the &quot;Lost Spanish Mission.&quot;
During the and dig the crew used transect sampling strategy, test
pits, gasoline powered post hole diggers, remote sensing, and
proton precision magnemeter. The advantage to these techniques
was that as little as possible damage was done to the environment
of the island and the disadvantage would probably have been the
cost of these methods. The methods employed were successful they
found the lost mission and preserved the island. 3) Middle Range
Research is basically the bringing together of both low and high
end archaeology; archaeologist do the observations, basic field
work, and the overarching research.The three mentioned types of
archaeology led to the larger body of Middle Range Research because
they study the habits of modern society and culture to base their
theories of the cultures of yesterday. 4) The scientific method
is basically: Issue, Hypothesis, Testing, Conclusion. This method
is used in archaeology in many ways, if an archaeologist is trying
to find a sight they would hypothesis on its locations based on
the environment, they then would test sites in search of an exact
location, and finally they would conclude it was their or not.
If an archaeologist discovers an artifact they can hypothesis
about its origin and use, they then can test it based on it make,
material, and what not they could conclude what its purpose is.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Flintnapping Experience <BR>
Date: 10/5/99.- Time: 11:23:36 PM.- Entry Num: 286<BR>
From what I understand the Flintnapping lab was very cool. Unfortunately
I was unable to make it to class that day so I wouldn't know,
however, I had gone to the lab the previous Thursday and what
I saw was pretty interesting. By doing this lab we were able to
see the level of understanding you must have of your tool and
material you are working with. I was also able to apply what I
saw in the video about Flintnapping. Hopefully I will have the
chance to go to another lab to work with stone tools and what
not.</P>

I did a search for garbology and was only able to find 2 web pages
that pertain to my research that would be informative. Most of
the addresses I did find were by one man and his specific study
of Bob Dylan. The two listed below are the ones I feel could be
useful to me: T e c h n i c a l Understanding Surveillance Garbology

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Prelim Proposal <BR>
Date: 10/19/99.- Time: 11:38:18 PM.- Entry Num: 67<BR>
Well lets see...I did not attend the flintknapping lab and have
chosen an alternative as my project. I have been looking into
Garbology,the study of people through their rubbish. My intent
is to find a person and do a preliminary interview of them asking
general question. After this I want to do a two week study of
their trash and find a conclusion. I than intend to interview
the person again and present them with my findings. I have yet
to decide who I will ask to be my project person but I'm waiting
to do more research on the whole topic before I start. I also
am planning to work with Stephanie a classmate. This is what I
have come up with to date but I do plan to develop it more.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: LD: Divine Mission Video <BR>
Date: 11/3/99.- Time: 12:49:15 AM.- Entry Num: 85<BR>
I think this video shows the time and money that goes into the
restoration of historical buildings and sites. I do think it is
important to restore these locations because it tells the history
of cultures and people. We can learn so much from our ancestors
and what they have done; we learn what is important to people
of the past and possibly what should be important to people of
today. The Divine Mission Video did show the relationship that
also develops between the workers and their location. Overall
the video was good in showing the restoration process, however
it did not keep my attention and that is not a good thing.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: LD: Restoration <BR>
Date: 11/3/99.- Time: 12:54:56 AM.- Entry Num: 91<BR>
Given the choice between restoring a building to its original
form or leaving as it is today, what would you do? I think I would
restore the building. I would want to document what each period
had done to the location to make it fit their needs or thoughts
but most of all I would want to see the building in all its original
glory no matter what that would be. I think if I were to restore
the building I would want to put together an exhibit of some sort
of all changes made during each time period. By doing this everyone
could see the changes throughout time and yet they could also
see the structure in its original form. So yes I would restore
the building but not without some record of its changes.</P>

<P>Author: Courtney Kuhn.- Subject: Virtual Dig 1 <BR>
Date: 11/10/99.- Time: 12:53:55 AM.- Entry Num: 123<BR>
This project was a good way to show us what exactly must go into
planning a dig. I think that we did not know the extent that archaeologist
go to to plan a budget, hire crew, buy equipment, etc....After
this exercise I now know the work that goes into deciding exactly
how many lab and site crew are needed, what transportation and
equipment is need, and so on. I also now better understand the
review process and how a budget has to be approved before the
digging starts. I plan to work this program on my own because
it would be interesting to see how I would do on my own.<IMG
