<p>On my final day at the excavation project at the San Juan Bautista Mission,
I continued to work on the same area at N10W38NE1/4. Some findings that
I had today were more floor tile, weighing in at a total of 136.2, it was
actually one big piece. I also found charcoal fragments weighing 0.6 grams.
Another interesting finding was a ceramic piece weighing 34.2 grams. It
was a beautiful piece that was glazed on both sides and still displayed
a fine texture. Glass that weighed 0.1 grams was also found, this glass
was a clear see through color. This piece of glass may have been a piece
from a large bottle, which may indicate that the area was disturbed. I
also found a short piece of thin white string, which was dirtied from the
dirt. The string weighed 0.6 grams and may also present that the area was
disturbed.
