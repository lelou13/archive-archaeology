<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This class, SBSA 224s, Archaeology: From Map to Museum
proved to be a very challenging and demanding class. Although the class
required minimal amount of hours for things such as homework and papers,
the requirements it did hold is what separates the class very uniquely
from others. There are not very many courses in this University that offers
a class where not only are you implementing your class lectures and activities
into field and lab works and activities, but you also then are required
to implement your technology skills as it pertains to the course.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My midterm self-assessment explains the initial reasons
why I had decided to enroll in the class. Essentially I had decided to
enroll in the class because of my sudden curiosity and interest in Archaeology.
As a freshman in the Social and Behavioral Sciences major, prior to entering
this university, I had no idea that Archaeology was a related field in
the Social Sciences. Thus, I decided to test myself by enrolling in this
Archaeology class to determine if it would be something I would emphasize
in as an SBSC major. As the course moved along and the semester carried
on, I realized that this challenge would definitely be a real learning
experience.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first part of this semester I felt really lost.
I was first intimidated by the fact that I was simply a second semester
freshman in a class with upper division students. Second, I was really
intimidated by the readings. I would do the readings and try to understand
them as much as I could, except that the readings were never discussed
over in class. As the class later moved, readings began to diminish. Feeling
very lost and confused in the class, I made myself present in every class
session to avoid missing assignments or directions, plus the fact that
I did not have any friends or acquaintances in the class also was a problem
for me.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as I began to attend more class sessions,
I began to feel more and more comfortable. I realized that the class did
not require a lot of non-class work, but in-class work. Every class I would
attend the lectures and participate in the journal entry assignments. I
found this very much more enjoying than the readings of course. I found
the slides that were shown in class so insightful, I learned so much just
from the slide shows alone. I also learned a lot from the videos that were
presented in the class. Everything that I learned from the slides and the
videos is well represented in my Lab Deliverables and my journal entries
because I always had a lot to write about.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this End Term Self-Assessment I should state some
of the skills and terminology that I’ve learned from this course. I learned
how Archaeologist used sampling and mapping skills for Archaeology digs
and projects. I learned about grid maps and sites and how to locate specific
regions and areas, such as which areas are simply "noise". I learned Archaeology
definitions such as site grid, which is mapping an area and creating a
method area. I learned about and what are Excavation tools from the class
lecture and actual fieldwork at the San Juan Bautista Mission. I learned
other definitive words such as stratigraphy, which are layers in excavation
units or layers of earth.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I also learned about different types
of materials. It was a very interesting deliverable how we were given a
chance to hold and study actual materials such as arrowheads, beads and
all types of stone tools. Then I also learned about flintnapping from the
class lectures and videos, and actual hands-on experience at the lab. I
also enjoyed the lab activity where us students acted like Archaeologist
and collected samples at random areas, then actually separating, labeling,
weighing and bagging our collected samples.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to my active participation in the lab
and class activities and assignments, I also participated in the fieldwork
at the San Juan Bautista Mission. This became to be the most challenging
aspect of the course. Although it deemed to be difficult in the beginning,
my excavations at the Mission became to be comfortable as I became more
aware of what I was doing. As I learned more on how to sift properly (wet
&amp; dry methods), on how to label certain items (such as floor tile,
glass fragments, bone fragments), how to fill out the sample card, and
simply bagging and cleaning up your collected samples; I began to feel
much more confident of what I was doing. The findings and experiences I
acquired through my excavations at the Mission are all fully logged in
my project journal.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that I have completed all of the requirements
for this course. I have completed all of the Lab Deliverables in depth,
from 1-6. I completed Major Deliverable 1, the Midterm Self-Assessment,
in the proposed due time. My project proposal, Major Deliverable 2, was
to participate in the excavations at the San Juan Bautista Mission, and
I have completed all six participation requirements. Major Deliverable
3, my journal review, clearly shows that I have attended class on a regular
basis and have kept up to date on all assignments. I have also completed
Major Deliverable 4 Portfolio assignment, both electronically and hard
copy.&nbsp; I have participated in the Lithics Labs, Class lectures such
as the slide shows, videos, lecture on Garbology, and group activities
in class. I am confident that I have successfully fulfilled the intended
outcome-based learning goals for this course, and that my grade should
reflect that.
