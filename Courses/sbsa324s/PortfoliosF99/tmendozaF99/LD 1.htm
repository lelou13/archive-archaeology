<p>My method of choosing my samples and transects for each step was very
random. The first step was to pick 10 grid squares that would represent
an area on the map that I would be interested in studying. In doing so
I chose samples, U2, v2 v4, u4, u3, v3, u1, v1, t1, t2. These samples draw
out the region of the map I thought to be most interesting to dig up and
research. The second step was to pick 5 transects that would be of interest
to me in studying also. These were very random picks. I chose transect
B because it contained a residential area already discovered. I chose transect
9 because going down on it it covered a lot of possible hills and high
regions where people might have chosen to live. I chose transect T because
I was also interested in researching an area that seemed like a valley,
because ancient people might have chosen to live there because of fertile
lands. I chose transect U for the same reason as T and it was a short distance
to cover which would cover more in-depth research. Finally I chose transect
V because it contained the largest area of residential. The third step
was to choose 10 grid squares on the basis of predicted settlement. I predict
that the ancient peoples would have chosen to live on high regions and
fertile lands (valleys, near the bay, near the river) because of the times
that they lived in. Therefore the grid squares I chose were areas that
looked to me like a hill or mountain or an area near a river or bay. They
were, B9, K13, W7, G8, V3, L9, V4, L5, N8, Q3. The last step was to select
5 grid squares that factored out noise. I chose areas that pretty much
had nothing on them, just blank areas on the map. They were, C2, J1, K1,
K2, E15.
<p>My results in the mapping activity were half/half. In strategy one,
I did hit an area with my chosen grid squares. In fact, it was a very huge
area and I somehow chose a large portion of it. My predictions were correct.
In strategy two, I hit 3 out of 5 random picks. Transects 9, U and V were
my correct transects that contained sites. In strategy three, I hit 4 out
of 10 sites, they were grid squares W7, V3, V4, N8. A large amount of the
sites were in the bottom region of the maps, perhaps because of the climate.
With strategy 4 I was not very successful and hit only one site at O10,
a very small site. All in all I was most successful in strategy one and
three. My last step, step 4 I chose grid squares m12, o14, o15, o10, and
H12. They were regions I chose as noise.
