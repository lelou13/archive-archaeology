<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4></center>
On the afternoon of my fourth trip to the Mission, I continued working
on the same site and level, N10W38NE1/4 Level 2.&nbsp; The goal for the
afternoon was to reach level 3 at 40 centimeters. On the way, quite a lot
of artifacts were found. Similar to the morning, in the afternnon another
1,000g of floor tile was found in the site. What was more amazing was that
as we got deeper in the site, many more interesting artifacts began to
appear. THe first was a beautiful ceramic piece found at N56cm W35cm at
D40cm, and weighing about 43.7 g. It appeared to be Brunido ware, perhaps
originating from the English about 150 or so years ago, according to Chris,
Dr. Mendoza's assistant. The piece contained artistry that is believed
to originate from the English, and of an image, sort of like a lighthouse
or house. Later on in the dig, two more ceramic pieces were found at level
2 at 37.5 cm and 37 cm deep. The two pieces, similar to the first, appeared
to originate from England or France. Those were the most interesting and
exciting findings for the day on the site I worked on. By the end of the
day, we did manage to take N10W38NE1/4 to the 3rd leve, at 40 cm.
