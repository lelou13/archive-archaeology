<font size=+3>Major Deliverable 3: Lab and Field Journal Review</font>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4></center>

<p><br>The main purpose of the Lab and Field Journal is to represent the
work that has been completed up to date in class and in the field portion
of the excavation and lab project. As such, this journal best reflects
my continued active engagement and participation in the Lab, Class and
Field activities and assignments. This journal also exemplifies my ability
to document my experiences and findings, both coherently and precisely.
<p>As the journal is reviewed, please notice that all fieldwork journal
entries are labeled, "Excavation Day…" in the Table of Contents. Also notice
the dates on the entries which represent the time and date those entries
were made.&nbsp; There are various entries that relate to class activities.
Such as video reviews and class activities such as the mapping sampling
strategy activity and the virtual dig. In addition to that, there are also
the material assessment activities, which are lab deliverables. Other entries
are Lab documentations, which are experiences and hands-on activities dealing
with flintnapping in the Lithics lab. Other entries consist of documentations
of lectures, such as the lecture on "Chichen" and Garbology.
