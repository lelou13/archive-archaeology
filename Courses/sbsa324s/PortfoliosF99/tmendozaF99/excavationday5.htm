<p>In my fifth excavation, I continued to dig in the same site area: N10W38NE1/4.
Today the level worked on was 3 with an objective of 60. Although the day
was pretty cold and a little breezy, the excavation still went on. Some
findings that were collected were, 1,000 grams of tile fragments, silt
stone fragments at about 60 grams and a large bone weighing about 17.7
grams. The bone appeared to be a piece of a joint, perhaps the ball in
a ball and socket joint, and may belong to a fairly large animal. One floor
tile that was found was pretty big, and did not appear too changed except
for being broken off a larger piece. The corner was still squared and the
top and bottoms were still identifiable to which was the floor tile’s top
part. At about 3 centimeters within level 3, I did run into a huge rock,
which Dr. Mendoza’s is suspicious of as being a part of the foundation.
The rock was fairly huge, laying at about the corner of the east and south
walls. In addition to this finding, I did notice that this level of the
site contained much more rocks and tiles. The past two excavations while
working at level 2 my total collections of tile weighed at about 3,000
grams, comparing to about 500 grams during level 1. I guess I’m beginning
to get down to the actual area where the foundation existed on, because
I am also seeing more evidence of ceramics and and less animal bones.
