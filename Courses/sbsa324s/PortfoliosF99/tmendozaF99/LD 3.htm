<p><font size=+1>Material Culture Activity 1:</font>
<p><font size=-1>Having found a chert core for flaking stone tools from
an archaeological site, this would make me believe that the people who
lived on the land knew how to build a fire and used this tool regularly
to make a fire. The Spanish colonial trade bead may be an artifact that
was either a trade with a Spaniard, or a Spaniard was living on the land.
The Borine tooth may indicate what kind of beef was eaten on the area,
or hunted. This may also indicate that those who lived in the area were
carnivores.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Material Culture Activity 2:</font>
<p>In viewing the codex, the first thought that comes to mind is that the
ancient Mexicans who created this codex were of a very rich culture who
chose to record specific events in their lives, in addition, had the capability
to formulate their own type of written communication through pictures,
symbols, colors and counts. I believe that the codex that was shown was
interpreted as a type of life cycle diagram that illustrated the lives
of these ancient Mexican People, the Seasons and how they lived during
those times, their riches, their beliefs and cultures. The codex gives
full description of their lives. This is how I feel the manuscript was
interpreted and "read." The specific section of the manuscript that I have
chosen is a scene where rich architecture is displayed. An ancient Mexican,
perhaps somebody of high status because of the elaborate hair dress and
costume, is inside a perfectly drawn circle decorated with intricate curls
all around on the outside of the circle. This shows that these people had
already discovered geometric shapes and perhaps not only applied it through
their drawings, codex, but also with their architecture in their village,
or home. Also part of the scene is an Eagle riding on some type of carriage.
This would depict that the Eagle was a very sacred symbol. The other two
images on this manuscript is of two individuals richly costumed standing
atop a platform, a platform with very detailed carvings. This may show
that these individuals were very important and played important roles in
the survival of the village therefore stood "above" amongst the rest of
the people. All in all, the primary theme in this manuscript, I believe,
is giving ode to the noble peoples or symbols (the eagle) that these Ancient
Peoples gave credit to. A few related items on the codex are the beads
with the different colors, these may all represent a type of count of something.
Another are the animals that stand beside some individuals, these are the
names as stated by the professor. Another is tree looking symbols, family
trees I believe is what these are.
<p><font size=+1>Material Culture Activity 3:</font>
<p><font size=-1>Amongst the artifacts handed to us for observation, I
think that out of 6, 3 of them were definite arrowheads, or tools used
for hunting. Artifact 4.7 was shaped trianguly with sharp edges and a fairly
sharp point about an inch long and its highest width at about 3/4 an inch.
Opposite the sharp point was a straight edge where the artifact must have
once been attached to an arrow or fishing line. Artifact 1.12 and 4.42
resembled 4.7 largely. Artifact 4.42 is perhaps an arrowhead used for long
and high aims because its length is much greater than those of the other
two and is much narrower in width, while being very light weight, perhaps
1 1/2 inches long and 1/4 inch wide. In comparison, artifact 1.12 is the
smallest of the arrowheads I observed standing about the size of my thumbnail,
perhaps a little bit bigger. The little arrowhead was perhaps used for
mainly fishing lines because of its size but fairly sharp point and edges.
Similar to the other two, it too was fairly smooth all around and lightweight.
One artifact that was tremendously different from the rest of the artifacts
I observed was number 4.37. This artifact was a possible carving and cutting
tool used for maintaining and sharpening other rock tools. This rock appears
to be very sturdy and sharp, while having much smoother surfaces than the
other stone tools. The color is a blackish coffee color with a little transparency
that gives it a very rich look. Perhaps this is an obsidian rock. I think
this was not used for hunting because it is a little bit heavier than the
other stone tools and would not hold on an arrow. In addition, I think
this stone tool served much more than one purpose.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Material Culture Activity 4:</font>
<p><font size=-1>My artifact is 4.30 with a Munsell Color of N2-0 (Grayish
Black). In the Munsell color chart it is being measured differently from
the other colors, where it is being measured by how gray the color is.
It looks to be a chert stone tool, lightweight with sharp edges.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Material Culture Activity 4b:</font>
<p><font size=-1>The cortex for Artifact 4.30 is primary in means of classification
for the flake type: complete, early-stage biface thinning. The two faces
have some parallelism showing no ridges or other surfaces besides the face
and back. I believe this artifact is mostly all of its own cortex even
after the flaking. This artifact may have had some pressure flaking because
the edges are quite sharp and defined. I do see a few flake scars on one
side of the artifact. I believe that the side with the least flake scars
is the exterior (dorsal) of the artifact, while the other side with the
most flake scars, is the interior (ventral) of the artifact because it
is the percussion platform</font>
