</FONT><P>Introduction:</P>

<P>&#9;To tell the truth archaeology seemed to be a lot of 4 things: one, getting dirty, two, digging (hell of a lot of that), three sifting, and lastly ID’ing. </P>

<P>&#9;Now all of that sounds really boring, and you know what? It is… </P>

<P>&#9;Pretty much, we showed up got the sifters, trawls, and all the equipment, and started digging. Now, you just can’t dig straight down, we had to go almost in sheets or layers. When we first started the ground was hard as concrete, but after a few weeks it rained and the stuff came up like Swiss cheese.</P>
<P>&#9;As we dug we had to place all the dirt into buckets not to spill a drop. This brings us to sifting. There are 2 arts, dry and wet. (Also known as, easy and messy) Dry sifting was pretty easy, you stick the dirt in the sifter and sift, no problem. The wet way, you put it all in the sifter and you wash all the dirt away. Very messy/muddy. After you have sifted away most of the dirt you look through the first screen very carefully trying to find any &quot;secret artifacts&quot;… then lift that off toss the junk, and look through the next screen.</P>
<P>&#9;I would have to say wet is more thorough, but takes a lot longer. I did find a lot more items though using wet screening. I found everything from bones/ teeth, jaw, to metal nails/barb wire, to pieces of pottery and glass. &quot;And a shit load of rocks&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Now, after you find all this stuff, you have to sit down, weigh it, ID it , and catalog it. This process can be rather boring and long. &quot;this is the reason I would never be a archaeologist&quot; </P>
<P>&#9;And that is pretty much it, if I had pictures or objects to show you I would. But seeing how I will never give this speech it really won’t make much of a difference.</P>

<P>Close with a joke or something..</P>

<P>THE END</P>
