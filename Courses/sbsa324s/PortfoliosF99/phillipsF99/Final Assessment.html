<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>In addition to fulfilling
a ULR, my objectives for this course, as with any course I enroll in are
always to learn valuable information I can use in my daily life as well
as my course of study. This course accomplished that for me. I found a
lot of the material fascinating and inspiring.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I was committed to being
actively involved in the Lithics Lab experiment and attend all class meetings
and Lab days. In this way, I was able to keep with the pace of the experiment
and not miss any important details. As a result, I learned a lot, had an
abundance of information and resources to work with in my Final Report,
and felt a sense of accomplishment.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I felt that the Online Journal
was a very effective way to record and respond to the ideas we were learning
in class. I participated in all of the assigned journal entries, even if
some of them were brief. In this way, I kept up with the pace of the course
and accumulation of information.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I am fairly pleased with
the progress of my final report. Since writing papers is not my favorite
activity, I am struggling to complete this one at the last minute, and
could have done a little better if I had started it sooner. However, this
was a challenging semester for me and I’m satisfied with my achievements
so far.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I find it fascinating that
the field of archaeology has scientists who can discern fairly detailed
facts about human activity at a site from the debitage found there, for
example, whether the person was left or right-handed or what stage of production
they were in when they stopped working on their tool. These and other insights
into human behavior will get more detailed as technology gets more precise
and I think this is valuable information about various cultures.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I’ve also always been intrigued
by the Mayan culture, especially the extraordinary symbolism in their artworks
and architecture. I would enjoyed studying the culture more and could justify
this endeavor in that it inspires me in my field. On plenty of occasions,
lectures spawned ideas for further exploration, which I took note of.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>One of the Lab Deliverables
I enjoyed most was the analyzing of the codex. I think more time could
be spent on this area of the course as it is a remarkable representation
of valuable archaeological findings.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Another Lab Deliverable
prominent in my recollection is the Divine Mission Video. This video covered
the technical and social processes involved in the restoration of a historical
site. The conservation principles of minimal intervention and respecting
the integrity of a work of art by not putting too much of yourself into
the work are important guidelines to follow if we are to honor the intent
of the work to be a reflection of human lives.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>My primary strengths with
this course have been my commitment to attend all the class meetings and
labs and keep up with the assignments along the way. I require improvement
in the area of final reports, which have always been a source of anxiety
for me. However, I made some progress in this area, even though I went
over the deadline.</font></font></b></blockquote>
