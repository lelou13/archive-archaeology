<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>1. The reason I enrolled
in this class was to complete my science ULR. The subject of archaeology
appealed to me because I love working with land and knowing its history.
I lived in Carmel Valley for five years and did landscaping on the property.
The owner has found many mortars and pestles. I still work out there when
I can. I would be participating in the excavation project, but I have a
commitment every Friday this semester. The title “From Map to Museum” also
had a special appeal to me. I worked for several years at the Monterey
Museum of Art and I thought there might also be some connection to a museum
with this course. Although this turned out not to be the case, the course
content has been quite engaging. I am glad I took this course.</font></font></b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>2. I have attended all class
meetings and participated in all Lab and Field Deliverables so far. My
commitment and involvement with them has grown as the semester has progressed.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>3. I feel that my responses
on the Online Journal have improved since the beginning of the course,
due to my becoming more comfortable with the material and the format of
the course. I am more satisfied with the later responses.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>4. So far, I have been exploring
the topic of flintknapping for my final project. My first attempt at the
actual craft was not very successful, but I have since read the handouts
and explored some websites. However, I would like to know more of what’s
entailed in the final report and what the Garbology Project involves before
I commit myself to one subject. I intend to use the Lithics Lab as the
subjectmatter of my final report. I need clarification as to what is entailed
in the final report.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>5. See above.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>6. I found Lab Deliverable
5 to be interesting. I enjoyed following the process that David Hurst Thomas
and his crew used to narrow their search for Santa Catalina de Guale Mission
on St. Catherine’s Island. Remote sensing, in particular, intrigued me
as I watched how they arrived at their conclusion. The Material Culture
Two exercise also interested me. I was fascinated by the detail of the
symbols we looked at on the codex. A third concept I found important was
introduced in the Chichen Itza lecture. In the past, man has theorized
using his own assumptions about what he sees and cannot understand. We
now see that Le Plongeon used European assumptions when he encountered
ancient Mayan cities. I feel this is one of the most important concepts
to keep in mind as I attempt a project: to constantly question my assumptions.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>7. The Lab Deliverable I
enjoyed most was the Video Review of the video about the mounds. I used
to visit an Indian mound near my house in Ohio regularly. I have always
felt intrigued by the mounds. Again, in the video, assumptions inhibited
the search for the answer to who built the mounds until Cyrus Thomas established
a link between Indians and the mounds. The Material Cultures 3 Lab perplexed
me. I felt I didn’t have prior knowledge about different types of stone.
I didn’t know how to describe it and really couldn’t envision what I was
looking at.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>8. For the remainder of
the semester, I plan to pay closer attention to detail and get clarification
of what is expected in the assignments. So far, my strengths have been
digesting the written material by taking the time to read and comprehend
it. However, I appreciate the time in the lab to get assignments done right
away as they can easily get piled up.</font></font></b></blockquote>
