Journal</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>SBSC 224</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Fall 1999</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Day 1 - September 30, 1999</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- On this day we began
to set up the environment for the stone tools experiment. First we taped
down a tarp which was marked with a grid, each square approximately 6”
X 6”. We were instructed to don leather gloves, protective eyewear and
to each obtain a piece of leather, also for protection along with various
tools for the project. The tools included a hammerstone along with antlers
for soft percussion.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- Each of us then selected
a piece of obsidian to work with. These varied in size and shape. For the
next hour and a half, we participated in the craft of creating stone tools
by hitting our obsidian core with the tools we had selected, with the knowledge
we had gained from a video the previous class meeting time along with instructional
handouts on flintknapping.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Day 2 – October 7, 1999</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- Today, we gathered the
debitage. To do this, we each picked, at random, two or three slips of
paper, each referring to a square on the grid. These were our assigned
squares for analysis. We were to gather the debitage in each of the squares,
keeping them separate. A chart was indicated on the board as to how to
categorize the pieces of debitage. The categories were as follows: &lt;1cm,
1-2cm, 3-4cm, 5-7cm, 7-9cm,&nbsp; and 9-12cm. We then weighed each piece
and reported our findings to Dr. Mendoza, who recorded them into a computer.
My grid squares were B13 and J11.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- The weights of the pieces
I found in B3 are as follows: &lt;1 cm: &lt;200 items - 4.5 grams, 1-2
cm: 28 items -&nbsp; 4.5 grams, 2-3 cm: 6 items -&nbsp; 3.5 grams, 3-4
cm: 4 items – 6.5 grams, 4-5 cm: 1 item – 5.2 grams, 5-7 cm: no items of
this size, 7-9 cm: 1 item – 251.7 grams. I categorized 5 additional items
found in B3 separately because they were made of a different type of material:
jasper, rather that obsidian as the others. These items weighed as follows:
&lt;1cm: 3 items – 0.2 grams and 1-2 cm: 2 items – 0.3 grams.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>- The weights of the pieces
I found in J11 are as follows: &lt;1 cm: &lt;100 items – 0.7 grams, 1-2
cm: 2 items – 0.7 grams, 2-3 cm: no items of this size, 3-4 cm: no items
of this size, 4-5 cm: 2 items – 20.3 grams.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Day 3 – October 21, 1999</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Today, we each chose a
new piece of obsidian to work with. My results were: two partially formed
arrowheads.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Day 4 – November 4, 1999</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Today, our work area expanded
into another section of the lab as we were filling up the room with debitage.
This day, I tried working quite a bit with an antler. I tried different
sizes of hammerstones as well. One of the flakes I came up with appeared
to be a fairly decent scraper.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Day 5 – November 11, 1999</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Today, I decided to work
in a self-guided manner of experimentation to see the size, shape and direction
of flakes as I worked, rather than try to imitate what I had learned in
the readings and the video. Since my skill didn’t seem to be improving
too much, I thought I’d act as if I were a Neanderthal woman starting from
scratch and creating a tool necessary for my survival. I learned a few
tips to better shape the pieces I was trying to create, but all in all,
I didn’t come up with anything too fantastic.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Day 6 – December 2, 1999</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Notes: Cores can be exhausted
by too much hammering, at which time a new core should be sought.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>PF – primary flaking: >80%
cortex/dorsal surface – stone minimally worked</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>SF – secondary flaking:
>1% &lt;80%</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>TF – tertiary flaking:
0% cortex – stone is usually being reduced to arrowheads</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>UF – unutilized flakes
– stone hasn’t been used, marginal retouch or attrition flaking</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Culture: humans have had
something to do with the modification of the material</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Use – sickle sheen – evidence
of use – appeared on obsidian when it was used to cut wheat; pollen left
on edge of tool. Wheat brushing the edge also polished it.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Mesopotamia – now modern
day Iran and Iraq – turned into a desert 10,000 years ago by human manipulation</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Obsidian – Neolithic Period
– New Stone Age – Agricultural era in Middle East</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Today we used the tools
we had created to cut different materials such as wood, cloth, leather
and antlers. We then put them in bags which we labeled for later observation.
We put each piece under a microscope to observe the edge used to cut with.
We drew diagrams of the edges showing what we observed under the microscope.</font></font></b>
