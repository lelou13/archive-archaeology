<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>In the five days I have
spent so far in the Lithics Lab, I have experienced a variety of activities
and received a multitude of information regarding stone tools, their creation
and study. These included trial flintknapping and the tools involved, the
gathering of debitage left by the flintknapping along with its precise
documentation, further workings with obsidian after having read a great
deal of material on the subject via handouts, and a self-guided experimentation
day in which I spent time working with a piece of obsidian in a trial-and-error
method to observe flaking and breaking of the piece, much like a Neanderthal
may have done when he or she first approached the problem of creating tools
for survival. I found that my skill level is not very high and this activity
does not come naturally to me. However, I plan to spend more time in the
lab with some pieces I have labeled for myself as well as attempt a few
more pieces. I am improving with each lab meeting.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I have been keeping notes
in a notebook so that I can use them later to present charts and summaries
of the activities for my final project. By attempting to create stone tools
in the lab, an archaeological site is being created by the lab participants.
In my project, I will attempt to interpret the data collected and determine
various conclusions to this study, based on what I have learned in this
course.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>I have requested several
books on the subject of stone tool analysis. I think these materials will
open the doors to new interpretations and analyses for me since this is
a relatively new perspective of looking at stone tools for me.</font></font></b></ul>
