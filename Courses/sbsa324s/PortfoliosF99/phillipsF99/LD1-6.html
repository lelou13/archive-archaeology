<p><b>8/27/99.- Lecture, Thursday, August 26</b>
<br><b>Today's lecture introduced maps and the role they play in an archaeologist's
work. Maps are used to document the relationship of an item to its surroundings.
Benchmarks are used as a reference point from which other things are measured.
The compass was also discussed. It consists of a floating, magnetized piece
of metal that is attracted to the poles. I learned that the North pole
was once the South pole until it flipped 6000 years ago. Since it is constantly
changing, compasses have to be adjusted to reveal true north. Are benchmarks
and point datum the same thing?</b>
<p><b>9/1/99.- Map Sampling</b>
<br><b>My five stratified of grid squares and why I chose them are as follows:
G7-near water and is elevated for protection. J12-appears to be highly
elevated with the land declining around it for quite a distance. This would
provide for protection. L2-elevated and close to water Q2-also elevated
and close to water M7-elevated and appears to be large to build a</b>
<br><b>considerable fort. The 5 transects I chose were G,J,L,Q and M which
encompass the grid squares chosen.</b>
<p><b>9/1/99-&nbsp; Map Sampling</b>
<br><b>1. ten grid squares selected at random:Q15,U2,H16,G1,J9,X6,C3,U3,P4,Q10</b>
<br><b>2. 2. five transects chosen at random: the 5 stransects I chose
were G,J,L,Q and M which encompass the grid squares chosen.</b>
<br><b>3. ten grid squares selected on the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; basis of predicted settlement:</b>
<br><b>4. stratified sample of five grid squares selected to factor out
noise: G7-near water and is</b>
<br><b>elevated for protection, J12-appears to be highly elevated with
the land declining&nbsp; around it for quite a distance. This would provide
for protection. L2-elevated and close to water, Q2-also elevated and close
to water M7-elevated and appears to be large to build a considerable fort.</b>
<p><b>9/1/99 - Map Results</b>
<br><b>I matched a site at Q2.</b>
<p><b>9/3/99 - Video Review</b>
<br><b>The question of who built the mounds and why was asked throughout
history. Earlier people could not imagine that the Indians had built them
and came up with theories that a group had built them as they passed through
the area to Central America or that they were built by a group that was
then destroyed by the Indians. The obvious links to the Indians were also
ignored because it would give the Indians claim over the land. A link was
finally established by Cyrus Thomas many different cultures of people instead
of just one. Archaeologists now label two types of mound building: the
Hopewell and the Mississippi. The Hopewell had elaborate artifacts made
from a variety of material from various places. A big change came when
maize agriculture came along. Increased productivity of the land due to
this type of agriculture brought increased population as well as a decline
in dental health and an increase of diseases from the lower protein intake.
There was also an end to the elaborate artifacts. The Mississippian Mounds
were larger and were the place where the elite lived and ruled the common
people. They organized the corn agriculture. Archaeologists have studied
the lives of the people to see how they could have built such huge mounds
without disrupting their daily lives.</b>
<p><b>9/7/99 - Material Culture 1</b>
<br><b>The Bovine tooth found at the excavation site would indicate what
types of animals were eaten by these people or possibly kept as pets. The
chert core would give insight into how they prepared food. The bead might
tell who they traded with by its contents and where the contents might
have come from. All three items would give indications of the time these
items were used.</b>
<p><b>9/8/99 - Material Culture 2</b>
<br><b>Two characters are shown pulling a rope taut between them. This
would symbolize technology since a rope shows that they were able to weave
together threads to create a strong, useful material. Another shows a character
sitting on what appears to be a thrown containing a reed mat, symbolizing
royalty. A third drawing depicts a character holding what appears to be
a rattle, which was used in war. The warriors would all carry them and
when they arrived at a battle, they gave the illusion of a huge rattlesnake
about to attack. A fourth item from the codex is a feathered headdress.
This makes a connection to the heavens. A character wearing one could be
a priest of some sort or a person about to be</b>
<br><b>sacrificed.</b>
<p><b>9/10/99.- Material Culture 3</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;-artifact 3.11 transparent stone with some yellow material
on the surface, rounded outward on one side, concave on the opposite side,
creating sharp points; semi smooth texture, approximately one inch by one
and a half inches, 1/4 inch thick. Its function appears to be a tool for
scraping or mashing or possibly ornamental; the sharp points could be used
to cut with.</b>
<br><b>-artifact 1.04 arrow head made of white and orange stone, rough
texture, approximately one inch by &frac34; inch, about &frac14; inch thick,
notched sides for attaching to a handle or arrow, blunt end probably due
to frequent use function: weapon or tool for killing animals for food.</b>
<p><b>9/15/99 - Material Culture 4</b>
<br><b>material culture 4 artifact #4.42 munsell chart color: 2.5 Y 2.5/1
blade tool-bifaced description: Distal end appears to have been broken
off, showing the cortex neckwidth approximately &frac12; inch length from
proximal end to distal end: 1&amp;1/2 inches appears to have been created
with indirect percussion with a flake tool and punch due to its precise
flake scars on the dorsal side along with some pressure flaking to strengthen
edges the only cortex remaining appears to be at the distal end where the
tip has broken off.</b>
<p><b>9/22/99 - Chichen Itza</b>
<br><b>When Europeans such as Le Plongeon encountered ancient Mayan cities
such as Chichen Itza, they had no way to understand the eclectic surroundings
they found themselves in. Le Plongeon was working during the end of the
Speculative Period, when findings were explained with much speculation
and mythology, using European assumptions. He could not attach the idea
of common people to such a place so he created the theory of Lemuria, an
ancient continent that had slid to the bottom of the ocean. Over time,
observers views began to change, first with the Descriptive Period, then
the Historical Period, during which people were starting to be educated
and questioned ideas. Then came the Explanatory period. There began to
be more of a multicultural view of the surroundings - people studied not
just the elite but started looking outside the temples. The Maya were finally
seen as real, capable of warfare.</b>
<p><b>9/24/99 - LD4 : Definitions</b>
<br><b>Stratigraphy is the study of layers of earth in the walls of the
pits that have been dug at an excavation site. Sampling strategy is selecting
smaller units of land within the larger unit for excavation Screening is
running dirt through a screen to catch important fragments too small for
the human eye to detect. Datum is a point of reference at a site from which
other points are shown as relative locations on a map of the excavation
site. A site grid refers to mapping an area by creating a series of NS
&amp; EW lines.</b>
<p><b>9/29/99 - Flintknapping Video</b>
<br><b>With proper technique, obsidian can be crafted into exactly the
shape, size and sharpness needed for various tools. Obsidian edges can
get as sharp as 2 microns - sharper than a surgeon's blade. When striking
the obsidian, the energy passes through the stone in the shape of a cone.
The angle of the hit can determine the size and shape of the flake removed.
When hit near the edge with a fairly oblique angle, some of the energy
is transferred inward. The edge should be carefully prepared before striking
it by rubbing the hammerstone along its edge to strengthen it. The shape
of a spearpoint is predetermined by culture: what the flintknapper is accustomed
to making. Since the spearhead needs to be flat, the hammerstone can be
used to remove long thin flakes by striking the end of the obsidian piece.
Besides using a hammerstone and direct percussion, antlers are used to
trim the edges. Antlers are also used in pressure-flaking: removing flakes
from the edge of a blade by pressing inward and down. The end of the antler
can also be used to serrate the edge making it sharper. Notches on the
end of the spearhead are made with a spatula-shaped antler tool. The spearhead
is flipped over and over, alternating faces as the notches are pressure
flaked.</b>
<p><b>10/3/99 -&nbsp; Lab Deliverable 5</b>
<br><b>1. Since it was impossible to excavate the entire island, David
Hurst Thomas and his crew began with random sampling. The advantage to
this was that it caused them to look in unlikely places. They took a 20
percent randomized sample of archaeology of St. Catherine’s Island. They
then investigated each site with two or more 1-meter-square test units,
adding up to 400 test pits. The target area was now narrowed down to the
size of 30 football fields. To further focus, the crew chose a technique
learned from Kathleen Deagan, a gasoline-powered posthole digger called
a power auger.&nbsp; Digging hundreds of 3-foot deep holes narrowed the
search to a target zone of less than three acres. At this point the field
strategy was switched to remote sensing. Remote sensing has the advantage
of being noninvasive and nondestructive while producing valuable geophysical
signatures of what’s below and archaeological site. In this case, the crew
was looking for evidence of wattle-and-daub buildings. To do this, they
used a proton precession magnetometer. All of the methods employed were
successful, because they discovered the church of worship at Santa Catalina
de Guale, the very heart of the mission they were searching for.</b>
<br><b>2. (3) The nature of Middle-Range Research is to link the past with
the present by using techniques that scan the times to discover knowledge
about the past. One such technique is Ethnoarchaeology. Also called living
archaeology, it allows us to hypothesize about past behavior from modern
behavior.</b>
<br><b>Through anthropological observation, it supplies bridging arguments
necessary to translate general hypotheses into observable outcomes that
can be expected to appear in the archaeological record. Thus attributing
meaning to empirical observations. A second technique, garbology (modern
material culture) also contributes to the body of knowledge called Middle-Range
Research. This method which started as a project studies all objects that
humans make or alter. It highlights the importance of applying archaeological
methods to discern modern ongoing trends and find out how material remains
relate to the behavior that produced them. It also attempts to find workable
explanations of specific and recurrent patterns observed in the archaeological
record. The third approach, Experimental Archaeology, is a study of the
archaeological process through experimental reconstruction of earlier conditions.
These experiments demonstrate given techniques that could have been used
in the past for processes such as flintknapping, and thus make significant
contributions to the growing body of Middle-Range Research in archaeology.</b>
<p><b>10/5/99 - LD6 Stone Tools I.</b>
<br><b>I thought I had paid close attention to the video about flintknapping
and was fairly confident I could repeat what I had seen with some success.
This did not turn out to be the case. The process seemed a little more
complicated than I anticipated. I tried to use the basic principles presented
to us such as selecting an edge that is less than 90 degrees to remove
the flakes. I found that I couldn't figure out how the flintknapper in
the video held his stone, which seemed to be significant. Because of this,
I couldn't get my flakes to go in the downward direction and ended up smashing
the rock in half. I had a little bit of success working with the antler
and creating a serrated edge for creating a scraper. I hope to have more
success next time, perhaps after I read the latest handouts.</b>
<p><b>10/19/99- Stone Tools</b>
<br><b>This day in the Lithics Lab was a good representation of the recording
process of an archeologist. I got a feel for what the real thing must be
like. I learned that attention to detail and careful written recording
habits are important. I can see the significance of categorizing sizes
and types of material for later analysis. I was beginning to visualize
links between the position and condition of debitage and the processes
that produced them. The grid was a useful tool to divide the materials
up into manageable groups.</b>
<p><b>11/3/99 - LD: Divine Mission Video</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This video was very informative about the process of restoration
of a historical site. The restoration of the Mission of San Xavier del
Bac was a community effort of Tuscon since state funding was not available
for the project. For a number of years, cement was used to rebuild parts
of walls until it was discovered that it retains too much moisture. Subsequently,
the construction company began using a process thought to be similar to
the original way of making mortar involving juice from a certain cactus
along with sand. They then began replacing all of the cement they had added
to the structure. Two rules of conservation were brought up: 1. Minimal
intervention and 2. Respecting the integrity of the work of art by not
putting too much of yourself into the work. Part of the restoration process
was described; injecting adhesive behind flakes, then gently pressing them
into the wall and gently removing dirt with swabs. Some say the elaborate
construction and artwork was done to impress the Indians and that it was
constructed as sort of a blanket the priests put around themselves in this
isolated place in the New World. A family tree showing the monastic order
and spiritual genealogy with the founding fathers at the bottom and Christ
at the top encircles one building and a mural of the life of Christ is
represented in another. This mission shows evidence of human beings who
achieved a level of perfection. It is a living sschurch where the original
mission endures.</b>
<p><b>11/6/99 - LD Restoration</b>
<br><b>I believe sculptures and other works of art should be restored as
close to their original appearance as possible even if it looks odd or
gaudy according to today's standards. Art is a reflection of the times
and lives of people. If we change the appearance of a statue to make it
aesthetically pleasing to ourselves, I believe we have rendered it insignificant.
It no longer carries the meaning it was created to express.</b>
<p><b>11/10/99 - Virtual Dig 1</b>
<br><b>I found this exercise very valuable. It gave a realistic picture
of what it takes to accomplish an archaeological dig and what is entailed
in getting a proposal for one approved. There were a lot of details presented
which enabled me to actually envision a project like this. Doing this exercise
as a group was useful because of the many ideas and points of view that
were brought up from students some of which were experienced and others
inexperienced in the area. I was surprised to see how expensive it is to
actually
make such a project happen, especially when the crew is staying in tents,
but I realize all of the details add up. It was also helpful to get feedback
from virtual anonymous evaluators so we could see what would work and what
wouldn't. I found that it was hard to anticipate exact counts of some of
the tools, etc. but I'm sure this aspect gets easier with experience.</b></blockquote>
