<p><font size=+1>This was a difficult project since I only have one set
of data from the lithics lab. The section that I chose and documented was
a very large sample and full of debitage. This is the reason I only had
time for one data set.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I think that since I didn't have a category for the four
to five centimeter range, that I may have included those in the "over five"
category. I spent a lot of time trying to present this data in a logical
way. It was not easy dealing with the different measurements.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In the less than one centimeter category, I had a lot
of dust and very small particles that I just couldn't count, yet they are
represented in the overall weight of the category. I had measured and counted
my samples before we changed the sizes to reflect five to seven range and
over seven. Therefore everything in my over five section could include
quite a variety, although there were only six items in that category, and
none of them were over seven centimeters long. The biggest variation for
weight and quantity was in the smallest and the largest ranges for weight
and number of items. The middle ranges were more equal in weight and quantity.
I think if I were better at Excel, I would better be able to represent
the data. I am not sure how representative my data is since I think I may
have made an error and I only had one set to look at. I find all of this
very interesting and would like to explore it further.</font>
