<br><b>End Term Self Assessment</b>
<p>I enrolled in SBSA 324s Archaeology: From Map to Museum because of my
interest in and desire to learn more about archaeology. I pretty much knew
very little when I enrolled in this class. I do realize how much there
is to learn. A lot of the things we covered in class, I had heard of before,
just lacking in working knowledge of the subjects. I feel I have gained
more knowledge and I have really enjoyed taking the class. I particularly
liked the hands on sessions, where we looked at arrowheads, etc. and made
stone tools. The times at the mission have been very enjoyable. I have
been there seven times and would love to continue working out there. That
has been a real learning experience for me. One of the most important things
I have learned is how crucial it is to document everything in your field
journal as soon as possible. It all boils down to being very organized
and meticulous. I must admit, I haven't kept as good of notes as I should
have, but now I see why they are so important.
<p>The online journals have been kind of hard for me to quickly gather
my thoughts and put them down in the journal. On the other hand, by waiting
until later, much is forgotten. I guess that I haven't felt that comfortable
in my knowledge to elaborate on the journals. I think I could have done
better. My mission journals reflect my lack of good note taking at the
time. I have since learned how important it is. I haven't expressed my
feelings so much in the mission journals as just documenting what we found.
I am really going to miss going there. I have become attached to N10, W42.
I just wish we had gotten farther down. It was just getting interesting.
We had been digging and finding a lot of burnt organic matter and adobe.
We finally reached an area that had a burn scar, so we were digging to
40 centimeters within that area, but did not find anything as yet. There
was a lack of adobe within that specified area. It is most likely a fire
pit. Going to the mission has been my favorite part of the class. I looked
forward to the dig every Friday.
<p>I would really like to concentrate in archaeology or anthropology and
like the idea of doing something for my capstone project on something Dr.
Mendoza has suggested to me such as a display of the history of Fort Ord
or the Native Americans in the area. I really think that Fort Ord is a
prime spot for a museum and I would like to work toward that goal. I have
been to the museum in Santa Cruz and in Pacific Grove and those seem to
be the only places locally that give any attention to the indigenous people
here in Monterey County. I really don't know what Fort Ord has in the way
of army displays, but I think there are some. If a museum were not possible,
then at least a room for a display would be nice.
<p>I have been very interested in the stone tools that we looked at in
class and have even found an arrowhead out here in upper Carmel Valley
where I live. There are also many Indian sites just scattered around this
area, some on private property, others along the creeks, and some in the
park up here. I guess it has been a problem in some local areas where people
were removing artifacts. There is also the threat of a dam to be built
in Carmel Valley that would destroy many of the recognized sites. These
things need to be preserved. Too many sites have already been destroyed.
I also thought the Maya Codex lecture was very interesting and would enjoy
further study on the subject. I would have liked to done more exercises
from the book and CD that we did in class from <u>Virtual Dig. </u>That
helped me understand what is involved in preparing for a dig and all that
goes into it. I also enjoyed the lithics extra credit assignment and wish
I could have collected more debitage and done another. I am not even sure
if I did it right, but I enjoyed doing it. I really have enjoyed everything
we have done in the class, finding it all very interesting. I have subscribed
to <u>Archaeology</u> magazine for the past two years along with <u>Smithsonian
</u>and <u>Natural History.</u>
<p>I think I could have done better in all the assignments and participated
more in the class, but I felt like such a newcomer. Social and Behavioral
Sciences is not what I intended to major in so most of the concepts are
very new to me. I need to learn more about methods and theories and how
to apply them to archaeology in specific. I hope I can get more comfortable
in this area of study since I would like to continue in it. I would have
liked to learn more about the museum in San Juan Bautista. I liked the
Mission Restoration Video and think they all should be preserved. I also
thought the documents were also very important. They help to understand
the everyday activities that went on in the lives of the missionaries and
the natives. I particularly like digging in the dirt and my favorite part
of the class was going to San Juan Bautista. I noticed many people did
not choose that option and some there didn't seem to enjoy what they were
doing. I didn't much like having to catalog everything, but realize that
is a very necessary part of the overall process. I will probably do better
in future classes now that I know more of what to expect and what is expected
of me. I look forward to it.</blockquote>
