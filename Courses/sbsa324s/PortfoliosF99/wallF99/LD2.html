<br><b>Video Review</b>
<p>The primary myths of archaeology in North America were that the native
people were too savage and barbaric to be responsible for building the
mounds. One of the beliefs was that the Indians killed off the moundbuilders.
Even when it was proven that the Indians were the same race as the mound
builders it was still hard for people to dismiss their racist beliefs,
in order to keep exploiting them and taking their land. Hunter and gatherers
were most successful and had much free time to engage in other activities
such as art.&nbsp; The invention of agriculture had the same effects on
civilization here as it did elsewhere. I think salvage archaeology is important
in that it can at least give us some insight into our past before it is
completely destroyed and in some cases give us cause to re-evaluate development
and even halt it or slow it down.

<p>I think it is important to restore the artwork and architecture to its
original state. I would probably make restoration a priority along with
education in order to gain interest and support for the project. Art should
be restored to the original whenever possible. Newer versions are noteworthy
and deserve mention only. San Juan Bautista relies a lot on tourism, so
the main focus should probably be on restoring those things that people
want to see such as artwork, buildings, and museums. Things that are in
danger of being lost or ruined should come first.
