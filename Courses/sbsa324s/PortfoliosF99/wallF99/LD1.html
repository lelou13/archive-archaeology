<b>Lab Deliverable 1</b><b></b>
<p><b>Map Sampling</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I used the grid aligned with
the top of the number rows even with the top of the map and the letters
on the inside line even with the left side of the map.
<br>1) I didn't know what I was doing when I picked these squares. M-6,
L-5, F-7,D-7,M-8, K-8, L-4, M-5
<br>2) 5, rows D, G, H, K, M
<br>3) L-4, J-4, K-5, I-6, M-4, H-7, I-7, G-6, F-7, L-7.
<br>4) F-7, L-4, K-4, L-7, J-7. I think I mostly based my choices on high
places overlooking or near water.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Map Results</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think I got many of them correct.
I think I may have switched positions on my grid.&nbsp; L-9 the heart of
major construction activity G-10 heart of residential areas. My first guesses
where in the right areas, though.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Virtual Dig 1</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a very difficult project considering
the lack of knowledge we have on the subject.&nbsp; There are so many considerations.
I guess each site would have different requirements so you just can't base
other digs on one or two examples. The salaries seem to range from two-thirds
to half of the overall budget. I think probably one of the most important
aspects would be in deciding the areas to be excavated. That has to be
done before anything else can be considered. This exercise showed me the
basic order in planning an archaeological dig. The many things to take
into account like food, accommodations, travel, equipment, salaries and
autos were obvious essential. Some of the other considerations less obvious
are specialists, insurance, airfare, and theodolite operators. I guess
every detail must be taken into account.
