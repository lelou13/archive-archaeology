</H3>
<B>Minimum Requirement:</B> Each student will be required to demonstrate
that they have developed the fundamental skills and obtained knowledge of
those basic technical standards required for the effective visual anthropological
and documentary use of the 35mm camera and related film mediums.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Initial Objective:</B> To study the concepts and methods, and work toward
the development of those specialized skills, underlying visual anthropology
and documentary and or investigative photography, particularly those pertaining
to anthropologically-informed photography and studio and lab methods germane
to photo-technical imaging.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ultimate Objective:</B> To produce a theme-based photographic portfolio
that serves to document a culture, subculture, or cultural or social theme
of contemporary or historical relevance.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Self-Paced Study:</B> Because this learning experience is primarily self-paced,
you may opt to complete assigned deliverables well before the end of the
term for preliminary assessment (i.e. specifically at mid-term), or for
overall assessment at end-term. The only other circumstances that would
affect self-paced or accelerated learning styles pertain to the fact that
all students are required to complete the same lab and field assignments
required of this learning experience. You may however opt to conduct the
field studies individually, and at your own convenience, so long as you
provide documentation of the field experience and its learning outcomes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Field Days:</B> Off campus photo excursions will be scheduled on Saturdays
at two and three week intervals through the course of the Fall 1996 semester.
While it is not required that you participate in the field excursions, such
field days provide an opportunity for you to initiate your community study
under the guidance of a field mentor. Our specific case study will entail
a visual anthropological study of the community of San Juan Bautista, where
Professor Mendoza has been engaged in an archaeological, historical, and
visual anthropological field study since September of 1995. The following
tentatively scheduled Photo Field Days will be conducted in the community
of San Juan Bautista, California:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Available Field Days:</B> 9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, September 28th, 1996<BR>
9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, October 12th, 1996<BR>
9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, October 26th, 1996 (TBA)<BR>
9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, November 9th, 1996<BR>
9:00 am-1:00 pm Saturday, December 7th, 1996<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lab and Studio Days:</B> On campus lab and studio time will be made available
on Tuesday afternoons by arrangement between Professor Mendoza and the students
of SBSC 395. Lab and studio demonstrations will take place between 3:00
and 6:00 p.m. Tuesday afternoons by arrangement. Lab and studio days are
tentatively set to take place in Building 110, which is the Service Building
fronting the front entrance (i.e. glass door entrance) of the SBSC offices
in Module 86A. Other locations will be announced as needed. Unlike the Field
Days, you are required to attend arranged lab and studio days so that you
may be introduced to the range of photographic methods and applications
available to the social scientist. Again, if you are able to demonstrate
an understanding of the methods involved in lab and studio concepts, you
are welcome to submit such documentation in lieu of attending the arranged
lab and studio times noted. The following three deliverables represent the
primary learning requirements expected of all students in this section:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="Portfolios.html">Deliverables Portfolio.</A> All materials produced
as a result of assigned readings, journal entries, and photographic assignments
based on a cultural or social theme should be submitted for preliminary
or midterm assessment no later than November 12th, 1996 (see Portfolio Requirements
for format standards). Submission dates will vary according to your self-paced
study and learning plan, however, you should target the period between October
15th and November 12th, 1996 as a general guideline for midterm evaluation
of your work. While electronic submission is appropriate for midterm portfolios,
the final photographic portfolio should be submitted in hard copy.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="../lab%20and%20field%20journal">Lab and Field Journal:</A> Your
Lab and Field Journal will be the second major learning requirement of SBSC
395. Said journal should include an ongoing assessment and working document
of the subject of your specific case study research and lab and field experience.
Journal entries should include dates, locations, technical and creative
information regarding photographs produced, and socio-cultural observations
pertaining to the community under study. In addition, because assigned readings
will serve as the basis for your introduction and skills-building in technical
imaging, you are expected to provide documentation that you have in fact
completed a body of readings that pertain to your specific area of study
(i.e. said readings may be those assigned or those identified as per your
specific research effort).<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="../assigned%20readings">Assigned Readings:</A> On lab and field
days, you should come prepared to address issues, discuss concepts, and
explore methods described in readings assigned in anticipation of said excursions
or labs. While not required, you may wish to consider documenting your readings
by way of brief typewritten summaries of those readings that lend themselves
most readily to your understanding of the primary concepts and methods of
technical imaging and visual anthropology; particularly as this may pertain
to your specific field study. Because of the growing body of internet and
World Wide Web resources in photography and visual anthropology (e.g. archaeological
photography), you may opt to use web site materials as supplementary readings.
The scheduled topics will include web site hot-links for your internet survey
of currently available sites pertaining to photographic methods in general,
and social science applications in particular. Your professor will endeavor
to post relevant sites under the topics listed in your on-line class schedule.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="Portfolios.html">Final Photographic Portfolio</A>. The final photographic
portfolio will be the primary requirement of this learning experience. Please
note that all final portfolios for this learning lab should follow the appropriate
format for that specified for the photographic portfolio, and should not
include extraneous materials that have not been specifically requested.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Assessment:</B> Primary assessment of your learning experience will be
conducted by way of scheduled interviews and portfolio reviews scheduled
with your professor at midterm and end term. Evaluation will be based on
evidence of your attainment of basic technical proficiencies in photographic
methods judged at midterm, and this in turn will be judged in the final
analysis on the basis of the quality and content of specific images and
critical commentaries and caption information included in the final photographic
portfolio.<BR>
