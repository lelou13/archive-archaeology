Submission of two short research projects equivalent to on the
one hand, a brief essay of between 750 and 1000 words; and on
the other hand, either a second essay of similar length, or a
project delivered in another medium such as internet web page,
film, video, photo essay, sound recording or oral presentation.
The precise form and content of any non-written project should
be negotiated with the professor for whom the project is being
prepared (i.e. Anthropology/Archaeology: Mendoza; Cultural Geography:
Yong Lao; Social History: Shenk).
