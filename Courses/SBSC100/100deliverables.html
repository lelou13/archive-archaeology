Note: All deliverables or assignments -- electronic and hardcopy
byproducts of this core learning experience -- should be directed
at your specific primary and secondary areas of inquiry and interest,
and should attempt to address the specific skills areas required
of your particular area of specialization. If you have yet to
determine what specific area in the social sciences is of most
interest to you, you may choose to address more than one primary
theme in your brief essays.
