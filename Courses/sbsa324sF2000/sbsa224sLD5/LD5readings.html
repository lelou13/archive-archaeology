<center><b>Lab Deliverable 5: Readings Review</b></center>
</blockquote>


<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Objectives:</b>&nbsp; The purpose of this lab deliverable is to
provide you an opportunity to work as groups so as to critically evaluate
the primary methods, concepts, and tools that serve to inform the use of
the scientific method in archaeology.&nbsp; Drawing on chapter readings
from the text by David Hurst Thomas (<u>Archaeology: Down to Earth</u>)
that were distributed to you in class today, and those readings assigned
to date from the Rice (1998) and Dibble (2000) texts, you are to discuss,
and later produce a brief essay review of the readings, that serves to
answer at least two the following questions.&nbsp; <b>Upper Division Requirements
(sbsa 324s): </b>Answer at least three of the following questions.
<p><b>Note:</b> Please be advised that you are required to draw directly
from regularly assigned class readings and those readings cited or distributed
in class (specifically Chapters 5 &amp; 6 of David Hurst Thomas' text)
in preparing your answers.&nbsp; The brief summary in question may be posted
to the Online Journal, e-mailed to your professor at ruben_mendoza@monterey.edu,
or submitted in hard copy format by the next class meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The specific chapters assigned for review may vary from lab to lab and
semester to semester.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Online Journal Entry:</b> In addition, during class time and discussion
this day you are to integrate into the Online Journal (or e-mail post to
your professor) a narrative of your reflections regarding your personal
participation and observations in the lab and or field exercises undertaken.&nbsp;
In addition, you are to briefly identify the primary concepts or procedures
and understandings that you have developed to date as the result of the
labs undertaken thus far.

<br><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What tools and procedures did David Hurst
Thomas and his crew employ in the quest for the "Lost Spanish Mission"?&nbsp;
What were the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques and procedures
employed?&nbsp; Were the methods employed successful (as per original objectives)
in the long run?
<p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do "archaeologists walk straight lines
and dig square holes" according to David Hurst Thomas?&nbsp; How does the
approach taken by David Hurst Thomas in his excavations of the Spanish
missions of Florida differ contrast from those of your professor in his
excavations of the Crescent Rockshelter or in his work at Old Mission San
Juan Bautista?&nbsp; How and why do you believe that the methods, procedures,
and objectives were different?&nbsp; [<b>Field Crew Members:</b> You may
draw upon what you yourself have experienced by virtue of the excavations
at Old Mission San Juan Bautista?]
<p><b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to David Hurst Thomas, Middle
Range Research permits archaeologists to generate "the knowledge necessary
to relate the world of archaeological facts to the world of general behavioral
theory" (Hurst Thomas, 1999:161).&nbsp; Given this characterization of
Middle Range Research in archaeology, identify and describe how it is that
Ethnoarchaeology, Garbology (Modern Material Culture studies), and Experimental
Archaeology all ultimately contribute to that larger body of knowledge
that constitutes Middle Range Research and its findings.
<p><b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, what is the scientific method,
and how is said method used by archaeologists in order to conduct lab and
field research?&nbsp; Be sure to define the scientific method, and how
said method is utilized in the field of archaeology!&nbsp; In your response,
please consider the following two characterizations of the Scientific Method:
<b>Kuhn (1970):</b> "In his conceptualization, science is conducted
within the confines of cognitive models (paradigms) consisting of exemplars
(strategies for solving scientific problems recognized by the particular
community of scientists) and disciplinary matrices (shared culture, values,
and norms that promote communication among members of the scientific community...Normally
according to Kuhn, scientific investigation consists of the resolution
of "puzzles" presented by the paradigm ("normal science").&nbsp; Research
is not conducted in order to challenge theory or evaluate it" (cf. Richard
Blanton, 1990: 2..."Theory and Practice in Mesoamerican Archaeology: A
Comparison of Two Modes of Scientific Inquiry" in <u>Debating Oaxaca Archaeology</u>,
ed. by Joyce Marcus).
<p><b>Popper (1959):</b> "In Popper's more rationalist interpretation,
the scientist starts with a problem and develops a theory or theories capable
of solving the problem.&nbsp; These theories must be falsifiable, and scientific
research is aimed at the falsification of theories, in whole or part.&nbsp;
Successful parts of theories -- that is, parts that have survived sincere
attempts at falsification -- may be incorporated into new, broader theory"
(cf. Blanton, 1990:2).</blockquote>
