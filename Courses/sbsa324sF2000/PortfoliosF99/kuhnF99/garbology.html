Given the opportunity to perform this experimentwe chose test subjects who are our peers. We believed our findingswould give us an insight on college dorm life as a whole as wellas our own lives. We chose to study two different dorm rooms,one of which is occupied by two females the other two males. Ourgoal was to see if college life portrayed by the media and societyhad actual truth behind it.</P><P>Hypothesis:</P><P>Female Subjects: We predict we will find a healthy varietyof food that for the most part originates from the grocery storeor the dining commons. We believe we may find some evidence ofdrinking but it would be rare, we also don't predict to find anyevidence of drug products. Most likely we will find evidence ofothers in the room, possibly social gatherings or boyfriends.We believe our female students will have little to no recyclable	containers in their garbage.</P><P>Male Subjects: We believe we will find evidence of daily fastfood runs along with a variety of heavy foods from the diningcommons. We predict we will see evidence of large sugar, caffeine,and alcohol intake. We will find some rubbish that shows otherswere in the room possibly of the opposite sex. We believe ourmale students will have more recyclable in their garbage.</P><P>Tests: We conducted a two week study of our subjects gatheringtwo samples of garbage, one each week from each room. Any itemwe were not sure about we confronted the subjects to ask questions.Below is the content list of each weeks findings.</P><P><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0">  <TR>    <TD WIDTH="50%">      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P>November 23, 1999 <BR>      Female Test Subjects <BR>      ( 2 Large Bags and 3 Small Bags)</P>      <P>- Boxes:<BR>      	1 Hanging File Folders Box<BR>      	1 Capri Sun Box<BR>      - Bags:<BR>      	1 Target Bag<BR>      	2 Luckys Bags<BR>      	1 Walgreens Bag<BR>      	2 Garbage Bags<BR>      	2 Produce Bags<BR>      - Recyclable:<BR>      	1 Odwalla - Wellness <BR>      	2 Arizona- Much Mango<BR>      	4 Mountain Spring Waters<BR>      	1 Sprite Can<BR>      	2 Lipton Iced Teas <BR>      	( 1 sweetened/ 1 unsweetened)<BR>      - Medication:<BR>      	1 Package/Dispenser- Birth Control<BR>      - Miscellaneous:<BR>      	1 Cup w/ Straw<BR>      	1bag Paper towels and Assorted Napkins<BR>      	1bag Mixed Plastic and Wrappers<BR>      	1bag Misc.

We found little evidence of caffinated beverages or softdrinks; however, we did find a large sample of candy wrappers.We were surprised to find a number of drink containers that couldhave been recycled and a lot of paper waste that also could havebeen recycled. We did find evidence of birth control which ledsus to believe one of the girls is sexual active or has problemswith her menstrual cycle. We found no evidence of alcohol or drugs.We did notice an increase in rubbish, which was recorded whenthe 	girls did have guest. We found evidence of a pet which isagainst dorm policy.</P><P>Males: We found no evidence of fruit or vegetables, however,we did find a lot of evidence showing fast food intake, mainlyJack in the Box and Taco bell. We found a fewer number of recyclablebeverage containers in the boys garbage then the girls. We foundno evidence under age.<BR>	</P><P>We were correct in many of our assumptions including eatinghabits. We were wrong about the amount of recyclable in each dormroom. We believed we would find more alcohol in the boys garbagethan we actually did. We did not include anything in our hypothesisabout birth control or sexual activity but were surprised to findbirth control in the females garbage and not the males. Throughthis project we found that there are some truths to the stereotypes of college life by the media but they do exploit it.<BR><BR></P><H3><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/r75.gif" WIDTH="583" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><A HREF="content.html"><IMG SRC="images/50.gif" WIDTH="36"HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><AHREF="oral.html"><IMG SRC="images/51.gif" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="36"ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
