<p><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;There were such lines as "Archeologists,
my life is in ruins" and "Archeologists tell forgotten stories," with these
lines we</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">can pretty much tell what it is that the
life of an archaeologist consists of.&nbsp; When I was doing my project
at the</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Mission of San Juan Bautista, I found that
Professor Ruben Mendoza would park his truck near the places where we</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">were performing our excavation.&nbsp; He
would do this do to the loading and unloading of the equipment that we
were</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">to use for the excavation every Friday.&nbsp;
While I saw his truck I found that he had some bumper stickers.&nbsp; One
of them</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">read "Archaeologists tell forgotten stories"
I found that this is true.&nbsp; Every time that I would find something
that would</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">look interesting to me I would call Professor
Mendoza, so that I could show him what is was that I had found and also</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">so that he can tell me what the artifact
meant.&nbsp; Professor Mendoza would come over and say, "This is interesting!</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">You know I believe this was used to perform…"
and he would go on to tell me a story of how the artifact was used.</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">By saying all this I simply prove that his
bumper sticker says the truth and especially about him.</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While at the mission
I found that at certain levels, in my square, there was a lot of debris.
Debris is a useful study aid</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">as it is how archaeologists make generalizations
and assumptions in the field.&nbsp; By examining debris, one can deduce</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">where and what stone tools where made, and
in what fashion.&nbsp; Melissa and I would find lots of debris and most
of it</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">just showed that it had been burnt.&nbsp;
By this we were able to tell that we were digging into a possible fire
pit.&nbsp; At the</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">beginning there was a lot of evidence that
this would be the case, but it was not until I got to the end of the</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">second level when I was able to tell that
we were in fact digging inside a fire pit.&nbsp; I feel that my overall
experience at</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">the Mission in San Juan Bautista was great
and of high learning.&nbsp; Sometimes I would stop and think if there was</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">anything else to archaeology than just getting
dirty, digging a lot, sifting, and logging.&nbsp; I found that there is
a lot</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">more to this than just what I mentioned.&nbsp;
Professor Mendoza did a good job in showing us what the different choices</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">are when becoming an archaeologist.&nbsp;
In class we saw all of the videos in which Professor Mendoza worked and
all of</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">the recognition that he received from different
news channels.&nbsp; Overall I feel that this class was one of the most</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">interesting ones from which I learned a
lot and gained extracurricular knowledge.&nbsp; Thanks Professor Mendoza.</font></blockquote>
