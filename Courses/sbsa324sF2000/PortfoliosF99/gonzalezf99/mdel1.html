<br><b>Major Deliverable 1</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1.&nbsp; The reason I enrolled in this course was because to me it was
interesting to do some
<p>Archaeology.&nbsp; When I looked at the class description of the class
I found it interesting to go to
<p>The Mission of San Juan Bautista and do some digging.&nbsp; I believe
that what I was looking
<p>forward to completing in this course have been somewhat completed.&nbsp;
The reason being is
<p>that I have learned more about archaeology and the purpose but I would
like to do more of it
<p>myself.
<p>2.&nbsp; I have come to class pretty much very often.&nbsp; The labs
that we have done I have attended
<p>and they were all very good.&nbsp; I feel that I have been committed
to the completion of Lab and
<p>Field Deliverables.&nbsp; I have been looking forward to attending more
and more the Fridays at
<p>San Juan Bautista, but due to my membership to the Men's soccer team
I have not been able
<p>to attend many of these.&nbsp; Other than that I will be attending more
and more of these labs in the
<p>Old Mission.
<p>3.&nbsp; The online journal has been a very important piece for me in
this class just because of the
<p>availability of sharing what I feel and or what I have done.&nbsp; I
use the online journal very often.
<p>I feel that the online journal does in fact adequately reflect the areas
of study undertaken by
<p>each of the deliverables.&nbsp; Personally I feel very satisfied with
using the online journal to do
<p>responses, comments and questions that I post to the Online Journal.
<p>4.&nbsp; In the field I have learned to be patient and not to get frustrated
if nothing is found.&nbsp; Being
<p>at the mission has taught me the different procedures in which we go
about doing some
<p>excavations.&nbsp; I have also learned to take everything that is found
in a very special way
<p>just because of the importance that it can represent.
<p>5.&nbsp; I am going out to the Mission.
<p>6.&nbsp; I feel that&nbsp; the most appealing things that I have found
in the Lab and Field Deliverables
<p>have been the different procedures in which the archaeologists go about
doing there
<p>projects and excavations.&nbsp; The most interesting for me is the way
the obsidian is used and
<p>shaped by the different tribes, and how it is that we can do the flintknapping
ourselves.
<p>Since I am doing the Field option I think that the reflected areas will
be of how it is that the
<p>search has to be done.
<p>7.&nbsp; I feel that I have enjoyed all of the lab deliverables just
because all of the challenge that it
<p>brings to me, I feel that I do not have any lab deliverables that I
have found not interesting.&nbsp; I
<p>would like to see that one of the days is a mandatory class trip, like
a class day, so that
<p>everyone has the opportunity of going to the Mission so that everyone
is exposed to field
<p>excavations and on hands archaeology.&nbsp; This way more people can
have something else to
<p>comment on when it comes to the Lab and Field Deliverables.
<p>8.&nbsp; I plan on improving by "practice makes better" by which I mean
that I plan on going more
<p>often to the San Juan Bautista mission so that I can get more and more
familiar with practicing
<p>archaeology and doing excavations.&nbsp; I feel that the main strength
has to be that I want to
<p>learn more about this subject and I think that this is the biggest strength
that I have.
