<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This past
Friday (11/12/99) I went to the San Juan Mission.&nbsp; I was partnered
up with Melissa Fanning and we started to</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dig through
the first level.&nbsp; Melissa and&nbsp; I found lots of stuff this Friday.&nbsp;
We found lots of burnt tile, some old red wood,</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colonial
nails, charcoal, and some stucko.&nbsp; We were able to find some blue
pigmentation material that might have been used</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to paint
part of the walls blue, of which we found some evidence of this.&nbsp;
We also found a piece of metal which seemed to have</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been used
as the handle of a knife that was used in the old days because of the way
the metal was wasted.&nbsp; A Coors Light Beer</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can as well
which was very interesting.</font>

<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the
mission this past Friday and continued to do the digging for our little
space. There was some interesting stuff</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that Melissa and
I found, such as some black piece that Chris said was a piece of bone.
We also found a lot of red tile as</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we got deeper
into the meter by meter square. It was interesting to have given those
little introductions to the kids that</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; came from the
San Juan School. They seemed very anxious to learn what it was that we
were doing and aslo to get into</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the prysical part
which was the digging. Melissa and I showed them how to do the screening
and told them what it was</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that we were looking
for so that they would participate in helping us. All these kids were very
excited to help and picked</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out anything that
had red on it and any large object that seemed abnormal to them. Later
that day we continued to do out</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digging and found
some colonial nails and some ceramics. We are almost down to our third
level. This coming Friday the</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10th we will be
able to start out third level.</font>

Time: 2:31:34 PM.- Entry Num: 169</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the last
day that completed the six times we were supposed to be out there. I started
to dig on both my side and</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissas. When
I started digging so that I would be able to get down to our 3rd level
I started to find a lot of bugs that</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were all over
the place. After a little more digging I found myself with some ceramics
and a lot of red floor tile. This day</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was interesting
because at the spot were I was digging I began to find the other side of
the fire pitt. Inside of it was a lot of</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rock and other
artifacts. Within those artifacts I found a piece of red glossy tile that
looked like the pots made in Mexico</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; called Ollas de
Barro. I also found bone even though I am not real sure what type of bone
it was or if it were from an</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; animal or human
a human. This was an interesting way to end my days at San Juan.</font></blockquote>
