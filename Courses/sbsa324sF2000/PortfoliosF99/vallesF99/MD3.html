<br><font color="#000000">On Friday 9/10/99 we went to Old San Juan where
we where oriented to the excavation process. We were given the opportunity
to be paired up with someone, I paired myself up with a community member
named Maria. We were dealing with an area at the 20 cm level. We worked
right next to the wall of the west convento wing and were able to uncover</font>
<br><font color="#000000">many interesting things. We found the common
tile, and we also came across what appears to be bone. We came across what
appears to be pellets or beebees, that was interesting because nothing
of that nature had been found. We washed the material that we found and
the next step was to label and log material found. It was a learning experience
and I can't wait to go again, because now I know to a certain extent what
to expect. I think this hands on activity gives us the opportunity to better
understand what we read and discuss in class.</font>

<br><font color="#000000">9/17/99 On this day we excavated at the same
level, which was between 20 and 40 centimeters. I came across bone, several
small pieces of different colored glass, wood, charcoal, seeds, and what
appears to be beebees or some sort of metal round ball, ceramic, a piece
of Spanish brick, and tile. It was a good turn-out, and I feel it is the
best way to understand the vocabulary and concepts discussed in class and
in the readings</font>.</blockquote>
