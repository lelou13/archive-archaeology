<font color="#000000">What was life like for the indigenous
peoples before The Missionaries arrived to Central California how did life
change and what did it change into?</font>
<br><font color="#000000">That is a question that arose during the time
the research was underway.&nbsp; It has become the focus of the entire
research because before the coming of the Spaniards to Central California
had the densest Indian population anywhere north of Mexico.&nbsp; Now,
it is the area, which is lastly recognized for that fact.&nbsp; Central
California is recognized more for the famous writer John Steinbeck than
for the rich culture that has become vastly forgotten.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">This report will be tied to the San Juan Bautista
Mission, which lies merely 17 miles north of Salinas, and 4 miles south
of U.S. Highway 101.&nbsp; It was founded on June on the 24th day in 1797.&nbsp;
It was founded by Fr. Ferm&iacute;n Lasu&eacute;n.&nbsp; San Juan was named
after John the Baptist and I chose it because it lies close by, and in
addition to that because of the excavation research I have conducted there
(Johnson, Paul 1979, 1967:241).</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;I will discuss in a more thorough manner
what the Native America’s lost to the encounter and what the goals for
the encounter with the Spaniards and Missionaries.&nbsp; I would like to
explore what was going on economically and socially that lead Spain to
impose cultural genocide of the Native peoples.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Just as well, I will touch upon the Missionaries
perspective on the “enlightening” of their arrival.&nbsp; Ultimately I
would like to discuss a period in time when nature and familism were the
core of a society and what levels of organization existed, and how that
deteriorated through the time passed.&nbsp; How it came to be that the
Missionaries, who came to civilize, cultivate, and spread the word of God
went against what they were preaching.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Economics and the push of religion were
the main driving forces behind the colonization of the Native Americans
in Alta. California, particularly Monterey.&nbsp; The result of this colonization
and the genocide of countless people, was a loss of a culture.&nbsp; A
forced acculturation was the result to the entering of Missionaries and
Spanish explorers in the land the Natives inhabited.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;When Spain’s hierarchy ruled a large portion
of the world, under Fernidad and Isabella, riches were the priorities.&nbsp;
Wherever they found abundance, they claimed the land in the name of the
crown (Johnson, Paul 1967:35).</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;When the Spanish arrived in California,
they encountered a territory already heavily occupied.&nbsp; Population
estimated have generally ranged in the area of 133, 000 (Kroeber 1925)
to 310, 000 (Cook 1978) for the number of Indians in California at the
time of White contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was already a sense of an organized
society.&nbsp; Where there existed more gender equality than there is in
our society, a trade-based economy, and complete use of the local use of
resources.&nbsp; There was recognition of the geographical area by the
Natives, and the vegetation or the mineral resources were used in moderation.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;One of the attractions that lured the Spanish
was the gold, the port of Monterey and the rich vegetation that exists
still today.&nbsp; Vizcaino was the primary expeditionary who was sent
to the coastal area of Monterey, which he named after the Conde de Monterey.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the “discovery” of a land, which was occupied by Costanoan Natives,
a plan to bring in Missions was created.&nbsp; It was a known fact from
the first contact with the Natives that they didn’t have guns or arms of
steel, making them easier to conquer.&nbsp; The decision to create missions
was to model the success they brought in Mexico.&nbsp; It would be an efficient
method that had already proved to function.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Missions killed two birds with one stone,
not only did they acculturate the Natives, but they also trained them to
various trades of work.&nbsp; They were trained to do everything from leather
work, texturing, or whatever other trade would bring money.&nbsp; By doing
so, they would become tax-paying citizens that would assist in making the
crown stronger.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;What I have found through the research I
have done is consistency.&nbsp; Many times the objective of the Mission
was to spread Christianity and other times it was to “civilize.”&nbsp;
Interestingly, the two goals went hand-in hand; to “civilize” was to teach
the word of the Christian God.&nbsp; One of the primary objectives of the
Franciscan directed mission programs in Alta. California was the transformation
of the culture and world view of the Indian converts congregated in the
missions.&nbsp;&nbsp; What they missionaries brought with them was a superiority
complex to believe that they were coming to save people and with the capacity
of transforming a people they didn’t know about.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; In order to understand the perspective
of the Franciscans and Spaniards we must understand the pressures they
were experiencing.&nbsp; There was an enormous demand for the missions
to develop ways to make moneys and use the Natives as resources from Spain.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;The mentality of the Franciscan was quite
different from the Spanish Expeditionary.&nbsp; The missionaries, regardless
to their personal blemishes as humans, truly believed that they were doing
well for the Natives and that they were saving them.&nbsp; Father Junipero
Serra, who founded the missions of Alta. California wrote, “Missions my
lord, missions-that is what this country needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They carried
out the beliefs of Christianity and considered themselves messengers from
God, but the manner in which they carried out the word of God was not a
peaceful one. For example, to make sure they learned the virtues of hard
work, the monks eschewed labor-saving devices and deliberately taught the
Indians methods that were difficult and outdated even at that time (Margolin,
Malcolm 1978:162).&nbsp; They administered cruel punishments to transform
the Natives into “gente de razon” –the European way of life.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; The Natives had knowledge of the land that
they occupied without books and lived a rather peaceful and organized life
with out any kind of governmental intervention.&nbsp; They named the trees
and the parts of each tree, its leaves and branches, distinguishing between
the various species.&nbsp; They named the heavens, the sun and moon and
all the stars they could identify.&nbsp; They identified and named parts
of the human body, and had knowledge of the circulatory system, so that
their Native doctors could minister them with knowledge and ability (Costo,
Rupert and Jeanette 1995:4).&nbsp; Besides having an accurate recognition
of astrology, anatomy, botany they had ceremonies and a nature-based religion
and medicinal knowledge.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;In the Native society, the elders were the
largest most influential party.&nbsp; Familism was the central driving
factor in everyday life for the Natives.&nbsp; People weren’t forced to
take responsibilities, a person did what the person did best, whether due
to superior strength, desire to do that kind of work, some special ability,
or traditional types of labor.&nbsp; In times of stress or catastrophe,
everyone did what was needed.&nbsp; There wasn’t any gender roles, if anything
women were more appreciated than in our very own “advanced” society, in
most groups she was respected as the keeper of the culture, the bearer
of the race and the protector of its existence and continuance (Costo,
Rupert and Jeanette 1995:48).</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Once the Spanish Inquisition came to Monterey,
and the Franciscans created a mission in San Juan Bautista, many changes
took place.&nbsp; Natives were physically forced to live a way unfamiliar
and unnatural to them.&nbsp; The main reason behind the majority of the
deaths and the leading cause behind the disappearance of the population
of Natives were European diseases brought by expeditions.&nbsp; The most
spectacular period of mortality among the American Indians occurred during
the first hundred years of contact with the Europeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Natives knew it was upon them, but could do nothing about it.&nbsp; There
seems to be a lot of resentment on the part of the Native populations in
this day and age for what they went through.&nbsp; Here you have an Indian
tell of happier days and his people before the Europeans came,</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">There was no sickness: they had no aching bones;
they had no fever; they had then no smallpox; they had then no abdominal
pain; they had then no consumption; they had then no headache.&nbsp; At
that time the course of humanity was orderly.&nbsp; The foreigners made
it otherwise when they arrived here.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;In summary, I found that what occurred was
an ambitious, unconscious genocide of the Native Americans who had their
culture ripped from them and they were reduced to substituting animas in
the work that they were physically forced to complete.&nbsp; The Spaniards
succeeded in their acculturation and not only did they make the Natives
transform, but also they eliminated the possibility of survival for many
Native American Nations.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;In conclusion, it was painful to go through
this research because my of my ancestral roots and how this research told
of how it is that we lost who we may have originally been.&nbsp; However,
I have reached the realization that the Franciscans, who came with the
best intentions, they came to spread the word of God and “help” the Indians.&nbsp;
Although I feel resentful of their arrival, as with the Spaniards, there
is nothing to be done.&nbsp; The only thing we could do is to try to retain
the culture we have and not let go.&nbsp; The missionaries thought they
were doing the Indians a favor by introducing them to the agricultural
methods, clothing, food, traditions, and a new language among other things.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Bringing things to a more geographically
recognized mission, we have San Juan Bautista as introduced earlier.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Beginning with the year it was built, 1797, I
will take you through its stages.&nbsp; It is interesting to note where
the priority in the building process went.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">YEAR CONSTRUCTION</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1779 Buildings constructed including a chapel,
quarters for missionaries, soldiers’ barracks, kitchen, granary and dormitory
for single girls and women.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1798 A large granary built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1799-1806 Main quadrangle of the mission built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1802 A granary and new soldiers’ barracks built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1803-12 A new large church, the present structure,
built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1810 A storeroom, pozole kitchen, and new quarters
for the missionaries built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1813-14 A new soldiers’ barracks built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1815 A dormitory built for single men and widowers
and six houses for Indian families.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1817 The walls raised on thirteen Indian houses.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1817-18 A mill built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1819 Six houses built for Indian families.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1820 Seven houses built for Indian families.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1821 Ten houses built for Indian families.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1823 Corrals built for cattle and sheep.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1824 Twenty-two houses built for Indian families,
and a corral built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1826 A corral and two small buildings built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1831&nbsp; A barracks for Indian vaqueros built.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">1832 A new dormitory with walled patio for women
and single girls.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">(Castillo, Edward and Jackson, Robert H. 1995:162)</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;It is also interesting to note that San
Juan had the largest estimated number of fugitives by the year 1832, compared
to the other missions (Castillo, Edward and Jackson, Robert H.1995:162).&nbsp;
Which again brings us to question the treatment of people who have to result
to crime.&nbsp; As one San Juan Bautista father mentions, they didn’t perceive
Indians to be very intelligent, which could have resulted in treating them
badly.&nbsp; Father Engelhardt believed the summary of his work was as
conducting “huge training schools, which transformed indolent and ignorant
savages into Christians and self-supporting members of civil society…”</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Many times the two clashed, the Indian and
the missionary, as in a story told by a local Salinan Indian about a medicine
man and a missionary.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Long ago there was an old shaman who had a reputation
as a rainmaker who could make rain whenever he wished.&nbsp; One year there
was a long drought and the Padre of the Mission said, “we will test his
powers.”&nbsp; He gave orders that the old man should be caught and brought
before him.&nbsp; Then he said to him, “If you do not make it rain so that
it will fill these barrels I will have you ties and whipped.”</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;It is good,” replied the shaman, “I will
try.”&nbsp; Then he sang.&nbsp; Soon the sky became overcast and with clouds
and it thundered.&nbsp; Then came the rain furiously; it did not delay
long.&nbsp; The barrels which the Padre had placed were filled quickly.&nbsp;
Then he told the man to stop the rain.&nbsp; And it stopped.&nbsp; “We
do not wish anymore,” he said.&nbsp; “No, there is enough already!”—Pedro
Encinales,Salinan</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Here is yet another example of the little
faith, or inferiority the missionaries felt towards the Indians.&nbsp;
It will be a long time, with endless tests before all people are given
credit and acknowledgments for their accomplishments.</font>
