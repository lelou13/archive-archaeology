<br>
<p>1. I have two main purposes for enrolling in Archaeology:&nbsp; From
Map to Museum.&nbsp; One of them is the fact that I recently found that
I may have had ancestors who inhabited this region of California, and it
is of my main interest to learn as much about it as I possibly can.&nbsp;
The other reason which I came to find out after being enrolled is that
this course covers the science part of the University learning requirement
that I've yet to complete.&nbsp; My objectives are to further my research
of the peoples both indigenous and immigrant missionaries who made this
central region of California their home--so that I can trace my family
tree.&nbsp; I have already uncovered which indigenous peoples lived here
and on the mission of San Juan Bautista's behalf, I now carry a basic understanding
of the geographical whereabouts the tribes in the central region made their
homes.
<p>2. I have participated in the lab and field deliverable to an unsatisfactory
degree, I do not feel I have contributed fully through my participation.&nbsp;
I have missed 3 class meetings and have missed 3 San Juan Bautista archeaological
meetings.&nbsp; I have tried my hardest, but do not quite recall if I have
or have not met the deliverable's schedule.&nbsp; I have committed myself
to an extent that has room for improvement, but am confident that I will
very much so improve in the class meetings and deliverables to come.
<p>3. I have used the online journal with no problems, however, I don't
feel that the quality of my journals is that which meets the requirements.&nbsp;
I feel this way because I don't have sufficient time in class to reflect
and mentally process what we have gone over in the class meetings.&nbsp;
I feel if I had more time to reflect and digest the information gained
in the meetings, I would have more developed and elaborated journals.
<p>4. I have progressed immensely, before this course I had only one perspective
from which I understood many of the things we have gone over, particularly
when it comes to Aztec and Mayan cultural and traditional beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had only the "Calpulli", and "Curandero" perspective and now ,&nbsp;
I have an unbiased academic point of view.&nbsp; As I have mentioned prior
to this point, I have gained a physical sense of where my ancestors may
have possibly been from.&nbsp; There are still many questions unanswered,
but I have learned more about the indigenous practices and have unlearned
what I thought I had already unleared before I received this unbiased scholarly
perspective.&nbsp; I appreciate and understand the archaeological concepts
because I have gone to the excavation site in San Juan and as a result
to being a visual learner, this hands-on training had helped me grasp the
different concepts involved in archaeological research.&nbsp; I will be
doing both the archaeological site and a final project report because I
have not been able to attend all the excavation meetings-due to lack of
transportation, and in hopes to uncover more of my ancestral history.
<p>5. I intend to do a research paper comparing and contrasting the academic
to the first hand Aztec cultural traditions and I plan to use direct interviews
with "Jefas/Jefes," "Calpullis," and online library journals, books, films
based on ethnographies and perhaps (if you are available) an interview
with you.
<br>6. I am fascinated with all concepts and areas of study we have covered
to this point in the semester.&nbsp; Pretty much all concepts and ideas
we have covered will be reflected in my overview-type research paper.
<p>7. I enjoyed everything because I feel I am learning and taking in different
aspects and concepts from cultures I feel I am a product of.&nbsp; The
only project I could have done with out, but I still feel it's necessary
has been the extensive reading on flintknapping.&nbsp; I am a visual learner
and it has not helped to read about it.&nbsp; You may want to keep it only
because it serves as a handbook/manual sort of reading for the actual flintknapping
project.&nbsp; I would recommend handing it out before the actual project
as opposed to after, so that students can have it with them while the do
the actual flintknapping.
<p>8. I plan on improving my overall performance in this course by not
missing any class meetings and trying to make it to the rest of the San
Juan excavation meetings.&nbsp; I also need to better my journals and keep
up with the deadlines.&nbsp; My primary strengths are coming in with an
open mind eager to learn.&nbsp; What I have been learning as far as the
Aztec and Mayan codices is very contradictory to what I thought I had learned
before the course.&nbsp; I still take in both sides only now I come up
with my own conclusions.
