<P>      Our last class period met in building 110, located on the northwest corner of</P>
<P>      campus. In this small laboratory building, our archaeology class recieved our</P>
<P>      second introduction to flintknapping. After a short demonstration by Dr.</P>
<P>      Mendoza, we were able to make our first attempt at flintknapping. I started out</P>
<P>      with a fist sized shard of obsidian. I proceeded to strike the obsidian with a</P>
<P>      hammerstone of approximately the same size in an attempt to create some</P>
<P>      workable flakes. After I had flaked away the fist sized obsidian to the size of a</P>
<P>      walnut, I selected the thinnest, most even flake. I did this hoping that this flake</P>
<P>      would be most appropriate for a projectile tip; thin enough to be workable, sharp,</P>
<P>      and hopefully have some strength. At this point, realize that I was wearing leather</P>
<P>      gloves and a leather palm shield; a piece of leather with a hole for my thumb.</P>
<P>      Flaking as I did required percussion flaking, and now it was time to begin</P>
<P>      pressure flaking. For this job I used an antler point. Antlers are compressed hair,</P>
<P>      but can get a fairly sharp point on them. I would hold the shard in my leather</P>
<P>      glove/protector in my left hand, and hold the antler in my right. I set the point of the</P>
<P>      antler against the edge of the obsidian and applied pressure, both up and down,</P>
<P>      to the flake. This caused the flake to appear both thinner and serrated. My</P>
<P>      triangular shard of obsidian was now resembling an arrowhead, although it was</P>
<P>      much too thick to be a menace to a deer. After this crude tool began to appear, I</P>
<P>      attempted to add notches to the base of the point. I believe these notches were a</P>
<P>      feature of the arrowhead that allowed them to be easily attached to shafts. For</P>
<P>      this job I used an antler with a thin, blade like point to it. Unfortunately, my notches</P>
<P>      did not reach very far into the point because of its thickness. This is now I ended</P>
<P>      my flintknapping session, with a thick projectile point with shallow nothces in the</P>
<P>      base. All around my feet were shards and flakes of obsidian, a result of my</P>
<P>      classmates and I working with obsidian. I think that my piece was of very poor</P>
<P>      quality, but then again, it was my first attempt at flintknapping. I think that if my</P>
<P>      livelihood depended upon it, I would become very adept very quickly at</P>
<P>      fashioning stone tools. </P>

<P>      1. David Hurst Thomas and his crew used several different methods in order to</P>
<P>      find mission Santa Catalina on the island of St. Catherines Island in Georgia.</P>
<P>      The first task that these archaeologists faced was the location of the mission.</P>
<P>      Vegetation had overtaken much of the island and had left no visible traces of the</P>
<P>      settlement above ground. The team used random transect sampling in its first</P>
<P>      attempt to find the site of the mission. This involved separating the island into 31</P>
<P>      east to west transects, with members of the team walking a percentage of these</P>
<P>      imaginary lines looking for potential sites. This method reduced the search area</P>
<P>      to the area of 30 football fields, which was much more focused than the whole</P>
<P>      island, but much too large to be thoroughly excavated. In order to reduce the area</P>
<P>      of the site, the crew employed the use of a gasoline power auger, basically a</P>
<P>      machine that digs holes. Artifacts found in the soil piles left by the auger were</P>
<P>      mapped in order to let the archaeologists know where high concentrations of</P>
<P>      artifacts were hidden. Using this method, the potential dig site was reduced from</P>
<P>      30 football fields to 3 acres. The great advantage of the auger was its ability to</P>
<P>      quickly dig holes and leave the piles of soil in easily searchable "doughnuts." The</P>
<P>      crew then began to utilize remote sensing in order to find the main structures of</P>
<P>      the mission. Since they expected to find "wattle-and-daub" style buildings, they</P>
<P>      used a proton precession magnometer. This device would be able to locate the</P>
<P>      iron found in mud daub plaster. A "magnetic contour map" of the site was</P>
<P>      created using the magnometer, which hinted at three particular areas within the</P>
<P>      site. When these areas where excavated, a well casing, domestic artifacts, and</P>
<P>      the "downed wall of a much larger mission building" were found. One</P>
<P>      tremendous advantage of using a magnometer is that no actual digging needs to</P>
<P>      be done. This can be an important technique for exploration in physically and</P>
<P>      politically sensitive areas. I think that the techniques and devices used by</P>
<P>      Thomas and his crew fulfilled his mission objectives beautifully. The Santa</P>
<P>      Catalina Mission digs also offers and example of how archaeological techniques</P>
<P>      have matured and changed in the past hundred years. 2. When Thomas and his</P>
<P>      crew first divided St. Catherines Island into 31 transects; they were bringing the</P>
<P>      overgrowth into the 21st century. These horizontal imaginary lines that</P>
<P>      "transected (hence the name)" the island were used as a tool in order for the</P>
<P>      researchers to better conceptualize their research area. By dividing the island</P>
<P>      into smaller portions, they were able to delegate responsibility to different people</P>
<P>      for different areas of the island. They were also able to further reduce the island</P>
<P>      into more manageable work areas. These same rationalization of being able to</P>
<P>      conceptualize the research area are why archaeologists "dig square holes." Test</P>
<P>      pits tend to be one-meter squares that can descend into the ground for many</P>
<P>      feet. By making the pits square, researchers are able to add a third dimension to</P>
<P>      their findings, "front to back, side to side," and "top to bottom." This is an</P>
<P>      improvement over finding artifacts later by sifting in that one can see specifically</P>
<P>      where the objects were in relation to each other. These square pits are much</P>
<P>      more time consuming and generally more fruitful than the results that an auger</P>
<P>      can give, as they should be. Augers are used to locate the areas where square</P>
<P>      pits where excavation subsequently occurs. 3. In the words of Thomas,</P>
<P>      middle-range research is "linking archaeological data with the relevant aspects</P>
<P>      of human behavior that produced it." Ethnoarchaeology does this same thing by</P>
<P>      observing firsthand similar behaviors that are related in either content or</P>
<P>      outcome. Observed relationships can be applied to a historical context and</P>
<P>      attempt to explain confusing phenomenon. These frameworks based on facts</P>
<P>      (theories) can contribute to larger bodies of knowledge by providing scenarios to</P>
<P>      explain cultural events. Garbology focuses bodies of knowledge concerning</P>
<P>      living individuals by letting us see exactly what people do, versus what they SAY</P>
<P>      they are doing. Similarly, garbolic archaeology can let us know what was going</P>
<P>      on during a time period in the past. If nothing else, we can GUESS what was</P>
<P>      going on…or what continues to go on. Experimental archaeology reminds me of</P>
<P>      participant observation, in that a researcher participates in similar cultural</P>
<P>      activities as the subject of inquiry, and makes observations pertaining to those</P>
<P>      activities. Gaining insights into hunting mammoths by hunting elephants with</P>
<P>      similar equipment is one example of this. </P>

<P>      "Flintknapping" was the title of the video that we watched in class today. Bruce</P>
<P>      Bradley took us through the process of creating different stone tools to help in the</P>
<P>      killing, skinning, carving, and hide preparation involved in hunting a bison. Using</P>
<P>      both small and large antlers, and different sized stones, Bruce created tools</P>
<P>      using pressure and percussive flaking. Pressure flaking was used to create a</P>
<P>      serrated edge, as well as for the delicate sharpening and notching procedures.</P>
<P>      Bruce used a notched antler and a small antler tip for pressure flaking. For</P>
<P>      percussive flaking, Bruce used the blunt end of a larger antler and two different</P>
<P>      sized stones. The larger of these stones was used to flake off a large piece of</P>
<P>      obsidian from the "motherchip." The smaller stone was used to thin down and</P>
<P>      shape the flake so that the antlers could be used. I think that a short video like</P>
<P>      this does a great job of introducing students to flintknapping, but can hardly do</P>
<P>      justice to hundreds of thousands of years of stone tool craftsmanship. An</P>
<P>      accurate and in-depth documentary of stone tools throughout human history</P>
<P>      would be a mammoth semester-long undertaking. This video did precisely what</P>
<P>      it was supposed to do, stimulate interest in flintknapping.</P>

<P>      Research design are the methodologies an archaeologist follows while in the</P>
<P>      field. These methods vary from dig site to dig site, depending on such variables</P>
<P>      as soil type and type of artifacts present. One such methodology would be to</P>
<P>      excavate two inches of soil at a time. As the soil is removed in two inch</P>
<P>      increments, findings can be carefully logged in a systematic fashion. The</P>
<P>      methods that are used should ideally best help answer the research questions.</P>
<P>      The research questions should address what aspect of the dig that the</P>
<P>      researcher wishes to be answered. For example, if stone axes are being</P>
<P>      excavated in a temple floor in Chichen, then a research question such as "What</P>
<P>      purpose did the stone axe play in the everyday life for the Chichen natives?"</P>
<P>      Another research question may seek to find patterns in architechtural design</P>
<P>      throughout MesoAmerica. "What are the the similarities between structures, and</P>
<P>      how did they occur?" might be an appropriate research question in this case. If a</P>
<P>      large area must be screened for potential dig sites, then site location is an</P>
<P>      important part of the archaeological process. Site location involves choosing one</P>
<P>      area over another. Such decisions could be made on such variables as proximity</P>
<P>      to water, elevation (for safety, and protection against invasion) , as well as by</P>
<P>      proximity to vegetation and animal life. These factors are all very important to</P>
<P>      daily life and could dictate whether or not a group of people would live in a</P>
<P>      particular area. Site location was an important factor in the crescent rockshelter.</P>
<P>      Dr. Mendoza was involved in a dig in an area that had previously been surveyed</P>
<P>      and deemed worthless. Site location was what let Dr. Mendoza find significant</P>
<P>      archaeological artifacts in the land while it offered nothing to previous</P>
<P>      excavators. Looking at soil samples (soil analysis) can help predict the liklihood</P>
<P>      of a significant finding, as well. Soil of a certain color can indicate human</P>
<P>      remains, bodily as well as garbolic. A soil sample can also serve as a type of</P>
<P>      dating system, to get, if nothing else, an approximate time period of the artifacts</P>
<P>      being excavated. </P>

<P>      The ancient city of Chichen Itza on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico affords many</P>
<P>      examples of sculpture, architecture, and daily life of an ancient civilization. Early</P>
<P>      scholars and archaeologists like Augustus LePlongeon came into these sites in</P>
<P>      the mid 1800s to look for leftover artifacts of the elite. In the process they</P>
<P>      described what the found and theorized about the origins of not only the artifacts</P>
<P>      that they found but the motivation of everyday events depicted in the city. The</P>
<P>      quality of the excavated carvings in the 1800s made early scholars very fortunate</P>
<P>      observers of Mayan culture. Today, we are still lucky enough to see these</P>
<P>      carvings, but not in the same splendor as they were 100 years ago. Erosion and</P>
<P>      fading due to sun, wind, and rain have faded the paint and physical intensity, but</P>
<P>      not the impression that they leave on an inquisitive mind. This site is important to</P>
<P>      the field of archaeology in that it makes a connection between ancient and</P>
<P>      contemporary Maya. Cultural swapping, such as the transposition of similar</P>
<P>      buildings, can be interpreted to show us patterns of migration and emigration.</P>

<P>      Artifact # 4.50 I believe the color of my small obsidian-like object is 5YR 3/2. This</P>
<P>      is an arrowhead like tool with a very dark red/black hue. The approximate</P>
<P>      dimensions are one half inch by one quarter inch by one eighth of an inch. This</P>
<P>      artifact may have come from a McKean site. It appears to be bifaced, as both</P>
<P>      sides were most likely used. I think this object was created using first indirect</P>
<P>      percussion and then pressure flaking. This object is secondary, as it has some</P>
<P>      cortex. It looks as if the object was flaked on one side more than the other.</P>

<P>      The items found at mission San Juan Bautista can show us what the residents of</P>
<P>      the mission were eating, wearing, and making during that time period.</P>
<P>      Recovered beads can show possible trade routes by tracing their origins. The</P>
<P>      bovine tooth could offer evidence of a food source or of accepted farming</P>
<P>      practices like plowing and planting. The chert core for flaking stone tools can</P>
<P>      help us predict the tools that were being made and being used at that time in the</P>
<P>      mission. These items of material culture are examples of everyday life; the way</P>
<P>      things were a hundred or more years ago. These three items taken together can</P>
<P>      tell us more than can the sum of the individual items. For example, the chert core</P>
<P>      taken in conjunction with the bovine tooth could lead to an educated guess of</P>
<P>      what kinds of plows, harnesses, and other farming equipment were being used</P>
<P>      at the time. </P>

<P>      The virtual dig lab deliverable gave us a sense of how to put together a budget.</P>
<P>      Putting everything together was very easy compared to real life budget</P>
<P>      planning-the computer program did everything. Just the same, it gives a sense of</P>
<P>      the difficulty involved in creating and submitting a grant proposal. It's too bad that</P>
<P>      in real life, funding is not this easy to scare up. Life experience would be useful in</P>
<P>      this sort of planning, especially when deciding who and how much to pay. I would</P>
<P>      be a very cheap principal investigator who would probably have a malcontent</P>
<P>      crew on his hands. I think that having an objective would make planning easier,</P>
<P>      as well. For example, if the P.I. is a university professor with an agenda, he could</P>
<P>      take with him the appropriate specialists to analyze the data in a meaningful way.</P>
<P>      Logistics are the main factor in planning an archaeological dig, but I suppose</P>
<P>      everything we budgeted today could be considered "logistical." I think that the</P>
<P>      primary factor in conducting a valid field dig is in the collection of the data.</P>
<P>      Specialists and analysts can always be hired later to examine the results, but if</P>
<P>      the results are flawed or useless, than the entire research project is of</P>
<P>      questionable value. Our proposal was accepted as "very good" upon</P>
<P>      re-submission. We had a few changes to make before we could have achieved</P>
<P>      an "excellent" rating. These small changes are the "headaches in the details"</P>
<P>      that are the obstacles to an archaeological excavation. </P>

<P>      Myths and Moundbuilders was the name of the film we watched today in class.</P>
<P>      One of the myths pertaining to the moundbuilders was that they were not built by</P>
<P>      ancestors of Indians found in the Ohio floodplains, rather, they were built by a</P>
<P>      "superior" race that had been in transit to Mexico. This racist hypothesis began</P>
<P>      to be disproved when skeletal comparisons found no distinguishable difference</P>
<P>      between ancient remains and modern Native American's skull and body type. I</P>
<P>      believe that this myth arose from archaeologists' disbelief in the abilities of</P>
<P>      Native Americans. The mound reconstruction was beneficial to archaeology in</P>
<P>      that is assigned some quantitave measure to the time requirments needed to</P>
<P>      construct an earthen mound. This experiment would also serve to give those</P>
<P>      involved an appreciation of what mounds are and what it takes to build them.</P>
<P>      This experiment could have served as to belittle the Native American's abilities,</P>
<P>      as the message that I received from the film was that they were fairly easily</P>
<P>      constructed, and that a decent sized mound could be built in one afternoon. It</P>
<P>      seems to me that salvage archaeology is often undertaken with considerable</P>
<P>      pressure from outside sources. Time constraints and construction deadlines</P>
<P>      would limit the thoroghness that an archaeologist would ideally strive for. At least</P>
<P>      some preliminary work is being done in these cases, instead of bulldozing and</P>
<P>      paving these ancient mounds and the artifacts within. Salvage archaeology is the</P>
<P>      recovering of artifacts. Unfortunately, deadlines limit the quality of the work being</P>
<P>      done. This is both a good thing and a bad thing, in that at least the work is being</P>
<P>      done, unfortunately, often underaken in less than ideal conditions. </P>

<P>      On this excavation date I worked in sector N10W38 in the south east quarter. I</P>
<P>      worked in taking this area down to the third level with another classmate. She</P>
<P>      and I took the eleveation from about 30 centimeters down to the third level,</P>
<P>      beginning at 40 centimeters. Not much was found in the tailings, just a few</P>
<P>      scraps of tile and glass. We did have a moment of excitement when we thought</P>
<P>      that we had found a human femur bone, but it turned out to be only a rock. This</P>
<P>      rock was interesting, found at 36 centimeters. It was the only rock of its kind</P>
<P>      around, with odd markings on its' surface. Perhaps when taken deeper, this</P>
<P>      sector will reveal more rocks that were the foundation of the old mission. Digging</P>
<P>      was difficult at first, when we began in the north west sector, but we added water</P>
<P>      to the soil to soften it, and in the meantime, excavated an adjacent sector.</P>
<P>      Another task that we undertook was pedestal removal of two pedastals in this</P>
<P>      sector. One pedestal was supporting a large rock at the disturbed upper level,</P>
<P>      and the other was supporting a large piece of terra cotta tile. This was a</P>
<P>      not-too-eventful dig on a beautiful day. </P>

<P>      Mission restoration is justified when it improves the condition of artworks toward</P>
<P>      thier original intended condition. I think that fighting for restoration, and then</P>
<P>      being unsatisfied with the result, is hippocritical. It is the integrity of the artwork,</P>
<P>      as the artist intended, that is important, not the effect that the artwork has on the</P>
<P>      person. For example, the Pope, when unsatisfied with the "pink marble," should</P>
<P>      be happy that the original condition was restored, so that the work could be</P>
<P>      enjoyed as intended, rather than expressing dismay at the actual result of the</P>
<P>      resoration. Similarly, at mission San Juan, I think that the preservation, beginning</P>
<P>      with the presentation, of culturally important works is an important step in</P>
<P>      understandig and interpreting life in the missions in the 18th and 19th centuries. </P>

<P>      The Divine Mission of San Xavier Del Bac is a mission near Tucson, Arizona</P>
<P>      that is currently operational. It is the recipient of a fortunate, needed, and costly</P>
<P>      artwork restoration project that appeared to have a vivid aesthetic affect on the</P>
<P>      mission and its' services. The participants of the restoration included several</P>
<P>      Italians who had previous experience with chapels and missions. One resident of</P>
<P>      the town ended up marrying one of the restoration crew in Europe! The movie</P>
<P>      played up this marriage a bit, and cute as it was, it seemed a little off in this</P>
<P>      documentary. This mission was built in a tumultuous time of American and</P>
<P>      Mexican history. Built just as Mexico was becoming independant of Spain, this</P>
<P>      mission was abandoned by the Franciscans and occupied by the Spanish a few</P>
<P>      years later. The townspeople kept the church in various states of repair, until a</P>
<P>      non-profit organization was founded in 1978 to repair and preserve the church. I</P>
<P>      think that re-doing the masonry was a very important part of the restoration that is</P>
<P>      perhaps less glamorous than restoring artwork, but perhaps more necessary. I</P>
<P>      would like to see some of the same restoration happening at Mission San Juan</P>

<P>      I was unsuccessful in all prediction attempts for the excavation site at</P>
<P>      Xochicalco. I was one square away from La Parcelo, but I doubt that proximity</P>
<P>      would have helped me in this case. I was somewhat accurate in my prediction of</P>
<P>      transects p and 8. Both of these had traces of settlement on the map. I would</P>
<P>      have had much success when the secondary map/settlement was displayed.</P>

<P>      In our laboratory learning experience on October 7, we completed the second</P>
<P>      portion of our flintknapping experiment. Whereas on October 1st we had created</P>
<P>      crude obsidian tools, this week we analyzed and measured quantitatively the</P>
<P>      byproducts of stone tool production. We did this by randomly choosing a square</P>
<P>      on a grid that had been placed beneath us when we were flintknapping. All the</P>
<P>      squares were different in the large grid, some teeming with debitage and others</P>
<P>      virtually empty of debris. My first square, B-5, had a modest amount of content.</P>
<P>      The first step that I took was to place all the obsidian fragments from the square</P>
<P>      onto a tray. When all the debris was on the tray, I separated the debris into piles</P>
<P>      by size. One classification for debris was "5-7 millimeters." I also classified (by</P>
<P>      size) debitage "over 3mm" and "1-3 mm." My largest group contained pieces</P>
<P>      between 3 mm and 5 mm. After I separated the pieces by size (with a tape</P>
<P>      measure) I filled out informatical cards to assign information to the different</P>
<P>      classifications of my shards. I filled out these cards with the sector information,</P>
<P>      breakdown of shards, and the weight. I weighed the debitage with a scale</P>
<P>      provided by the Dr. Mendoza, our instructor. With the shards weighed, classified,</P>
<P>      and bagged, the experiment was almost complete. We read off our information</P>
<P>      to Dr. Mendoza who inserted it into an Excel spreadsheet for analyses and</P>
<P>      graphical representations. Many of us in the class repeated these steps for more</P>
<P>      than one square of the grid, particularly if we had "slim pickins" in our first draw. I</P>
<P>      ended up "excavating" two squares, and helping a classmate with another. I</P>
<P>      found this experiment both more precise and tedious than our introduction to</P>
<P>      flintknapping. This is to be expected, as I have been socially conditioned to enjoy</P>
<P>      making a mess, but not to clean it up. It is really an impossibility for a researcher</P>
<P>      to claim objectivity, when all of us have been shaped by events particular (and</P>
<P>      even scarier, common) to our lives. </P>

<P>      I selected sites that I thought would be the easily defended. In a society wrought</P>
<P>      with conflict, higher elevations are more desireable for safety and defense. This</P>
<P>      was my rationale for choosing (not quite randomly) j13, k9, k5, p5, q3, p13, l9,</P>
<P>      m5, q10, l3. I chose l, p, k, q, and 8 as transects because it seems that they</P>
<P>      intersect areas of high elevation on the topographical map. My stratified sample</P>
<P>      of five squares consists of j13, k9, l3, q10, and p5. This is the condensed version</P>
<P>      of the first ten squares I chose to excavate on the site of Xochicalco. </P>

<P>      Mapping is essential to documenting and recording discoveries. Spatial</P>
<P>      relationships can be analyzed using geographic coordinates of a mapped</P>
<P>      location. These analyses can provide insight through proximity to resources such</P>
<P>      as water and fertile land. Accurate recording of the locations of artifacts within a</P>
<P>      site is important in understanding past behaviors and events.</P>

<P>      This Friday I worked at Mission San Juan Bautista for two sessions. I began</P>
<P>      excavating N10W38SW1/4. Mike and I excavated this sector down to the third</P>
<P>      layer, or 60 centimeters. We took turns excavating and screening the excavated</P>
<P>      materials. Using this method turned out to be very effective in achieving our</P>
<P>      objective of 60cm. We found bone, glass, and charcoal fragments along the way.</P>
<P>      I had not catalogued charcoal before, and we used a tinfoil pouch to save it and</P>
<P>      prevent contamination if the lab were used to date the materials. We found two</P>
<P>      ceramic shards, one white, and one blue and white with a design. Perhaps the</P>
<P>      most interesting find of the day was a possible button that Mike found in the</P>
<P>      screen. There appears to be letters or initials on the button that perhaps signify</P>
<P>      its' military significance. This button is not in the best of conditions but is an</P>
<P>      exciting find nonetheless.</P></FONT></BODY>
