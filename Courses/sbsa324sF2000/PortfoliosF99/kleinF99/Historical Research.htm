<P>&#9;Throughout the history of California, people have wanted to shelter themselves from certain elements of their surrounding environment, as evidenced by the usage of doors, fences, walls, and even caves.  Today, we find ourselves in the same position, only with new barriers to protect us from old problems.  The gates protecting the entrances to Pebble Beach reflect the desire of those living inside to restrict access to outsiders.  This segregation through separation is not limited to Pebble Beach, however.  From the earliest manifestations of the gated commmunity to planned, enclosed developments, these communities have been designed to protect their residents from an undesirable element of society.  I believe that this policy of gating developments is environmentally harmful and serves to reinforce social inequality.  By using Pebble Beach and other communities as examples, this paper will illustrate the social and environmental aspects of gated developments.  </P>
<P>&#9;Social aspects of a gated community include relationships and attitudes held toward other people by a resident before he or she moves behind the walls, as well as those formed by the resident as a result of living in such an area.  Environmental aspects of a gated community will include harmful effects caused by developments and their residents, as well as efforts taken to preserve the area impacted by residences in the community.</P>
<P>&#9;The earliest gated communities in America were located on the east coast as a retreat from the rush of city life.  The construction of these havens show the desire of the wealthy to separate work and leisure, an unfortunate trend that continues today and adds stress to an already stressful life.  Tuxedo Park was a gated suburb  in New York that was built in the 1880’s, and is one of the first of its kind in America.  At this time Pebble Beach had no gates, and had just been bought by the Pacific Improvement Company.  The gates were added a few years later, which may reflect common methodologies of developers trying to create at upscale atmosphere.  Developers soon realized that the prestige and protection that gates symbolize were often an attractive feature to prospective buyers, as evidenced by the boom in gated communities in the 1960s.</P>
<P>&#9; The contemporary gated community in California first appeared in Seal Beach in the form of Leisure World, a retirement complex for seniors.  These retirement complexes often offer scheduled activities and security gates for the residents.  They offer a place for retired people to live in a comfortable and convenient environment.  However, there are often restrictions for potential residents.  One family member must be at least 55 and often no quadrupeds are allowed.  There are a limited number of visitors allowed per year, and often the resident must live in the community for the majority of the year.  These rules and regulations stabilize property values by reducing traffic and improving the esthetic of the community.   Leisure Worlds and other retirement communities such as Sun City have since been developed in many places in California and the world.  The southeast area of the United States, euphemistically referred to as the &quot;Sun Belt&quot;, has seen a large number of these communities spring up because of the year long mild temperatures.&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;Observing the popularity of gated retirement communities, other developers saw a market for selling them to middle-class citizens as well.  This trend began in the 1970’s, and was a significant event in the history of the gated community in California.  Previously, this particular kind of development were utilized exclusively by the rich and retired, but now the advantages offered by a gate were available to the masses.  The housing industry is a fairly competitive business, and during this time developers installed gates in ever increasing numbers as they saw their peers doing the same with success.  Marta Borsanyi, a national real estate developer working for Robert Charles Lesser and Company, said in an interview in 1997 that she estimates eight out of ten new urban developments are gated.  (Interview with M. Borsanyi, November 27, 1993, as cited in <U>Fortress America</U>)  What does this trend suggest about the values of society today?  To answer this question, we must examine the motives of those who decide to move into these walled enclaves.  </P>
<P>&#9;People decide to move into gated communities for many reasons. In fact,  these housing areas are classified into categories by the motivations of the residents who live within the walls.  Three distinctive types of these communities are lifestyle, prestige, and security.  (Blakely &amp; Snyder, 39)  </P>
<P>&#9;Lifestyle communities’ most prevalent manifestation is that of the retirement village.  Developments such as Leisure World and Sun City are lifestyle communities, as they offer a complete living experience for their residents.  Golf &amp; leisure and &quot;new towns&quot; are two different types of lifestyle communities.  Golf &amp; leisure developments are marketed towards people of a working age, often as a second home.  An appropriate example of this community would be the proposed Armstrong Ranch, to be built alongside of Highway 1 just north of Marina, California.  This &quot;ranch&quot; will offer a golf course and be marketed towards those who work and have to commute to the Silicon Valley.  A third type of lifestyle community is the new town, a master planned development that frequently includes schools and shopping centers.  These new towns are marketed towards the middle class, and offer the most striking example of commodified community.  When you purchase a home in a new town community, you are buying a lifestyle.  You are buying membership into an exclusive area, complete with neighbors and education for your children.  These types of communities are built with privatization in mind; public services are often contracted out by the homeowner association to limit contact with the outside world.  These services can include trash disposal, road repair, and law enforcement.  I see characteristics of these communities in Pebble Beach, as well.  The proximity to many golf courses can make the availability of a golfer’s way of life an attractive feature for many potential home buyers.  Lifestyle and prestige communities differ in the importance placed on status and stability.</P>
<P>&#9;Prestige communities target wealthy homeowners who seek status and stability.  Living in a gated community is a sign of status for most people, especially when you consider the high cost of the homes inside.  Thus, the gates become an alternative means of prestige through conspicuous ownership.  I believe the gates located in Pebble Beach are definitely a symbol of status.  There are guards to keep out undesired individuals, including those who cannot afford to pay the entrance fee.  The acknowledgement recieved by a resident who tells others that they live in Pebble Beach can also be a motivating factor for a buyer interested in Pebble Beach.  The status offered by residing in Pebble Beach is not likely to change in the near future, offereing stability as another feature of this community.   Stability is also created through rules that are normally created by a homeowner association.  These regulations control how a person can modify and treat their property.  Certain actions are forbidden, such as installing basketball hoop, or even parking in the street.  These restrictions are often enforced by a private security company hired by the homeowner association.  A homeowner’s association is a group formed of property owners who make decisions concerning their community.  The purpose of all of these rules and regulations are to are to establish control over the land in order to stabilize property values.  These restrictions are not limited to only prestige communities, as they are also found in the retirement community.  Not everyone is happy with the restrictions placed on their homes, however.  In one retirement community, an 85 year old violin instructor sued her homeowners association because they wanted to restrict the number of students that she taught each day.  She was allowed only so many visitors per day, and her classes violated a restriction established by the community’s homeowner association.  The desire to stabilize property values are not limited to those who live in gated communities, however.  As Kenn and Joyce Morrison state in a letter to the City of Marina Planning Commission concerning a proposed development that would flank their property, &quot;In the developers plans they propose housing prices would range from $250,000 to $500,000.  For us to benefit from the appreciation of our home, my wife and I would like to see single family homes in the development ranging from $350,000 to $600,000 no less than 2400 square feet.&quot;  (Morrison, October 27, 1998)  As we can see from this example, houses are seen not only as homes, but as investments as well.  This is especially true in exclusive areas like Pebble Beach, whose exorbitant mansions become trophies for the rich.  It is estimated that fifty to sixty percent of those who own homes have primary residences outside of the gates!  From this it is a short leap to see that these homes are viewed as vacation sites; perks of those able to manipulate capitalism to their favor.  I am writing this paper shortly after a jaunt down 17-Mile Drive, and the images of excess that I saw on that scenic stretch of coastline are still with me.  The private putting green that I drove by is the most striking example of this; even surrounded by expensive golf courses, this person felt a need for their own private green in their front yard. This particular piece of private property serves to elevate the status of the owner, which is a defining characteristic of the prestige community.  However, as a prestige community places primary importance on stability, a security zone community values exclusion of someone or something. </P>
<P>&#9;Security zone gated communities are unique in that the residents install the gates instead of the developers.  Often barricades are erected instead of gates, but they both serve the same purpose of existing as a physical barrier between a perceived problem and the homeowners.  This type of community is common in urban areas, and the barriers often serve to limit traffic through an area.  One entrance and exit to an area is frequently desired by the residents, and this plan is often implemented when emergency vehicle access is available.  These gates are installed in order to reduce crime, as well.  By restricting access to their neighborhoods, people seek to control what occurs inside of these zones. These communities are similar to Pebble Beach in that the gates reflect the desire of the residents to keep something or someone out.  Whereas gates installed for security are built to deter crime and traffic, the Pebble Beach gates deter the lower classes and add an aura of exclusivity to an expensive area of California.</P>
<P>&#9;It should be noted, however, that any particular community could simultaneously posses characteristics of two or more of the categories discussed above.  Pebble Beach is a great example of this as it not only offers status to its residents, but close proximity to many world class golf courses.  I view this coastal area of California as a hybrid community that combines elements of prestige and lifestyle communities.  Services that have traditionally been supplied by public services such as garbage and road repair are contracted out to companies based nearby.  Residents pay for these services through their homeowner association, as well as by the thousands of visitors who visit Pebble Beach each year.  Have you ever wondered where the money collected at the gates goes?  The gruesome sum of $7.50 collected for each car goes to road repair, as it has for almost a hundred and twenty years.</P>
<P>&#9;First installed in 1882, the Pacific Grove, Carmel, and Carmel Hills gates were designed to attract visitors to the Del Monte Hotel.  Apparently, exclusion has been an attractive feature for some time.  A toll was instituted in 1913, although livery fees had been charged before this time.  This fee was charged to cover the extensive cost of building the road, which at the time far exceeded the quality of other roads in California.  While other roads in the area were at best constructed of gravel, 17-Mile Drive was paved!  At this time in California history, this costly process was known as macademization.  Guests staying in the Del Monte Hotel could take the hotel’s carriages through the gates for free, while visitors not staying in the hotel would have to pay a fee for the privilege.  This hotel was built by the Pacific Improvement Company, a corporation interestingly enough formed by Collis Huntington, Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, and Mark Hopkins.  These men made up the &quot;Big Four:&quot; railroad barons who bought the 7,000 acres of Pebble Beach with big plans for development from a man named David Jacks in 1915. Pebble Beach golf course was completed in 1919 in an attempt to increase the appeal of the land that Del Monte Properties was selling.  Morse began a profitable sand-mining operation in Spanish Bay in the 1920’s, and upon his death in 1969, ownership of Pebble Beach fell into the hands of a Chicago aggregate company.  Wedron Silica Company bought Pebble Beach and mined it for sand until the California Coastal Commission was formed in 1973.  The restrictions placed on what you could discharge into the ocean by this legislative entity forced Wedron Silica to sell, and in 1977 20th Century Fox bought the by now legendary Pebble Beach with profits floating around from the release of their high grossing motion picture, &quot;Star Wars.&quot;  Marvin Davis bought 20th Century Fox in 1981 and began to sell its assets at a huge profit.  Pebble Beach was sold to Minoru Isutani, a Japanese businessman, in 1990.  Isutani was an unpopular owner as he rarely visited and had suspicious plans for Pebble Beach’s four golf courses.  Isutani sold Pebble Beach to the Taiheiyo corporation in 1992 for a loss of around $267 million dollars.  This history of Pebble Beach provides context for understanding the environmental impact that Pebble Beach and other gated communities impact upon the land.</P>
<P>&#9;A lawsuit against David Jacks in 1840 delayed the development of the land for forty years, but free-enterprise prevailed when Jacks won his court case with the help of the Big Four.  Fifty years of sand mining at Spanish Bay devastated an area of Pebble Beach, not to mention the adverse effects that mining wastes had on sea life when they were dumped into the ocean.</P>
<P>&#9;Native plant life can be threatened when residences landscape with invasive species.  These plants can spread out from gardens into nearby wilderness, competing with other plants where no competition existed before.  When the invasive species thrive, it can alter the biodiversity of an area by causing changes in the food chain and eliminating the weaker species.  In Pebble Beach, the company landscapes with native species, but I am unclear on how long this practice has been their policy.   </P>
<P>&#9;The Del Monte Forest Plan, an addition to the gated community of Pebble Beach, is a proposed development that would see the construction of a new golf course, an equestrian center, and 316 new homes.  This expansion into the existing Del Monte Forest would require the destruction of a large number of Monterey pines, a proposed endangered species native only to the central coast of California and three other locations worldwide.  Not only would these Monterey pines be directly affected by felling, but by the effects of a compromised habitat would make the remaining pines especially vulnerable to pitch canker.  Pitch canker is a tree fungus that kills trees, and an ever-growing problem in the Monterey area.  When a grove, or cluster, of Monterey pines are attacked by this fungus, generally only the outermost trees are susceptible to pitch canker, leaving the inside region relatively disease free.  When a house is built inside of a pine grove, however, the inside trees are cut down, leaving an outside perimeter of trees that have no protection against pitch canker.  </P>
<P>&#9;A new golf course in this area would require vast amounts of chemical fertilizers in order to keep the fairways fair and the greens green.  These chemicals do not disappear when they are applied to the ground, they are absorbed into our water supply and drain into the ocean.  Gated communities often reduce biodiversity by restricting an organisms access to land previously used to grow, graze, and hunt.</P>
<P>&#9;Hilton Head island, a gated community in South Carolina, can illustrate an example of environmental impacts that development can bring.  Built on a wetland that recieves a large amount of rain each year, Hilton Head development has contributed to increased flooding &quot;by altering the natural drainage system provided by wetlands and by comvering more of the island’s surface with impervious buildings, roads, and parking lots.&quot; (Danielson, 135)  Attempts to build water retaining ponds have proven ineffective, and in some cases serve to concentrate pollution. Effects of building in an environmentally vulnerable area are sometimes unforseen, and sometimes expected.  </P>
<P>   &#9;When developers know that their projects will have an adverse effect on the land, and will sometimes design apparently environmentally conscious features into their construction projects.  These features are often fantastically emphasized by the company, not only to gain support from the locals, but to provide a means of defense against groups opposing the development.  For instance, when a developer plans a housing development in an area frequented by wildlife, a buffer, or safe zone, is thought to offer a safe route for animals desiring to travel from one area to another.  This solution is of limited value to the animals themselves, as a development through their habitat will often cause them to move elsewhere.  The Pebble Beach Company utilizes these techniques with astounding finesse.  Beautiful pamphlets, printed on recycled paper, of course, convey the message that they have the forests’ best interests at heart.  &quot;The Plan permanently preserves 690 acres of Del Monte Forest lands.&quot;  Well, what about the acreage destroyed by the development itself?  Claims of this nature are of limited believability, seeing as they are attempting to develop land dedicated as a scenic easement thirty years ago.  In 1967, Collins Polo field and a surrounding 27.8 acre area were dedicated in perpetuity the land for equestrian related activities.  The Del Monte Forest development would violate this easement, and has many residents up in arms.  A non-profit organization, the Concerned Residents of Pebble Beach, was formed to help uphold the validity of the easement and &quot;prohibit the construction of a golf course on these properties, as proposed by Pebble Beach Company, which would be an obvious violation of the recorded easement.&quot;  (Concerned Residents of Pebble Beach, October 1998).  The Sierra Club and the California Native Plant Society are opposing this development because of the resulting adverse effects of plant and animal life in Del Monte Forest.  A tree has become a weapon with which these groups are fighting back development through legislation and public awareness.  If these groups can classify species threatened by a particular development as endangered, it would make building in these areas more difficult and less profitable.  It is unfair, however, for me to paint the proprietors of Pebble Beach as drooling, slack-jawed, eco-nazis.  The Taiheiyo corporation has a budget of $1 million per year for forest preservation and upkeep.  Community outreach and environmental programs such as a native plant garden and mentor programs help give the company a degree of accountability, but we must remember that all these developments are in the company’s best interests.  It benefits them when their land and the land bordering it appear natural and appealing.  Property values inflate and increasing numbers of visitors are attracted, bringing with them disposable income that ends up in the pockets of the Pebble Beach Company.  As Masatsugu Takabayashi, president of the Taiheiyo company said, &quot;...we are not here only to squeeze money out of this jewel, we are here to polish it.&quot;  I think that this eloquently said statement summarizes any developer’s public image.  Not to rape the environment, but work with it in an atmosphere of mutual respect and pride.  Nature friendly homes marketed to environmentally conscious people, reuniting humans with nature with the profit motive hidden in the small print.  I would be more comfortable with this practice if the ulterior motives of the developers were stated up front and in bold print, and not hidden in the background.</P>
<P>&#9;I feel that this is deception, of the public, and the consumers.  Keeping the public in the dark makes it easier for corporations to make decisions that affect our environment and as such, ourselves.  My personal connection to this topic is my desire to inform myself and others about the practices that companies like Pebble Beach engage in on a daily basis.  By staying on top of current events and civic matters, citizens can make a difference.  Often these developments are kept quiet when they are in the stage when small groups of people can make a difference.  I have seen this happen with a proposed Super-Collider in the San Joaquin Valley, in Del Monte Forest, and I hope to be knowledgeable about the chain of command and channels of power next time I find myself in a similar position.  &quot;But John,&quot; you say, &quot;aren’t there any aspects of your current lifestyle that are conceptually and logically the same as the Pebble Beach Company’s actions?  To this I would be forced to say &quot;yes,&quot; as I see a few parallels.  I can see the Pebble Beach Company’s practice of limited &quot;conservation&quot; in my own behavior. Conservation, by definition, includes using the resources offered by the land.  We both use the land, and we do not seek the complete destruction of the land.  Whereas the Pebble Beach Company’s developments and land use policies are limited by laws and regulations, I am limited by my conscience.  When I go backpacking, I use low-impact camping techniques.  I pack out my trash, bury my personal waste, and even eat the apple core.  I don’t carve on trees and I restrain myself from throwing stones off of cliffs because my value system tells me that these behaviors are wrong.  Unfortunately, multinational corporations seldom have a conscience.  Luckily, in some areas and in some countries we have laws to restrict their business practices that are in place in order to maximize profits.  As Pebble Beach has been bought and sold so many times, so too have I bought and sold my resources for personal gain.  The corporations that have bought Pebble Beach have seen it as an investment; a way to make money.  I have sold my time to hotels, marinas, and most recently, a candy store, in order maximize my profit, leisure.  I am selling myself in the same manner as Pebble Beach’s many owners have, some at a loss and some at a profit.  In the game of capitalism, I am but a pawn.  Whomever possesses the Pebble Beach company, however, controls a rook.  These similarities between myself and the Pebble Beach Company will hopefully continue as I become more active and informed in the social and environmental policies of the Monterey peninsula.    </P>
<P>&#9;I would like to see future policy concerning developments in sensitive areas become more restrictive.  I think that the need for a gate should be proven before it is installed, and approved by a joint committee of both those living inside and outside of the gates.  It is important for the people of California that these policies be implemented for the preservation of the land, as well as to ensure the variety of living things.  Biodiversity is important for us because &quot;Every species has value, and each one depends on many others for survival.  If we lose too many parts of the puzzle, our entire global ecosystem is threatened.&quot;  Restrictions on the construction of gates is important to the people of California in order to perpetuate a sense of community between all members of society.  Gates divide people and often fail to provide the atmosphere that residents desire.  I do think that gates are needed in some areas, particularly locations that are threatened by crime and subject to traffic hazards. After informing myself to some extent on my topic of gated communities in California, I am amazed at process by which major decisions are made concerning these developments.  It seems a logistical nightmare for those wishing to buy and develop land, but perhaps that is why these people get paid such high salaries.  The resources are simply out of reach for Joe Taxpayer, as well as the knowledge of the beaurocratic procedure required for any large scale project.  It is up to me to involve myself and share my knowledge with others in order to form a more socially conscious and environmentally aware society.  This is my ultimate political goal, and hopefully the histories of both gated communities and of Pebble Beach have provided you with some sort of framework with which to view the social and environmental history of gated communities in California.</P>
