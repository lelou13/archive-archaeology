</B><P>&#9;In this deliverable on culture I will demonstrate how to write an ethnographic description and analysis of a culture.  Topics examined will include social structure, values, beliefs, and world views.  I will compare and contrast the components of culture against the ethnographic film &quot;A Chief in Two Worlds&quot; that we viewed in SBSC 300A, Theory and Method in the Social and Behavioral Sciences.  </P>
<P>&#9;I will start by giving a brief commentary on the topic of culture.  Culture is normally defined one of two ways, either materialist or ideational.  A materialist perspective of culture considers &quot;the sum of a social group’s observable patterns of behavior, customs, and way of life.&quot;  (Fetterman, 473)  This concept maintains that culture is best observed by the actions of a particular group.   An ideational perspective on culture, however, would consider that the &quot;...ideas, beliefs, and knowledge that characterize a particular group of people&quot;  allow the most accurate interpretation and analyzation of a culture.  (Fetterman, 475)  This would be known as a cognitive definition, as it deals with what people know, versus behavioral, which deals with people’s actions.  By dividing culture into more detailed categories, an ethnographer can pick and choose which subgroup will give him or her the most accurate interpretation of the culture being studied.  These divisions of culture allow seemingly insignificant or obscure details of a group’s behavior to be studied.  Small details are often the ones which define a culture and make it desirable for study.</P>
<P>&#9;The title of the film that we beheld in class was &quot;A Chief in Two Worlds.&quot;  This film took place alternately in Los Angeles, California, and a village in Samoa.  This film described John Hunkin’s role in the matai system and his change from a Samoan man to a matai, or chief.  The matai system is the Samoan way of governing, and to become a matai is a prestigious position in Samoan society.  John is one of about 60,000 Samoans living in Los Angeles, and like many others, came to America to work.  John works in a factory making $13 an hour and is able to send money to his relatives in Samoa.  If he lived in Samoa, he would be making fifty cents an hour laboring in the fields.  In Los Angeles, Samoan churches, stores, social agencies and gangs have sprung up for support for the local Samoan population, as well as for alternate means of gaining prestige and honor.  Clothing, ceremonies, and tattooing are symbols of Samoan identity and pride that we were able to view in the film.  One man we saw wore a T-shirt recognizing his ethnic identity and promoting Samoan culture.  A ceremony in a park was also shown, with members of the Samoan community in costume,  singing and dancing.  John himself recognized his ethnicity through the ceremonial tattooing of his body.  These tattoos were not necessary to become a matai, but in the words of John, &quot;people think I’m Mexican, but if they see my tattoos they know I’m Samoan.&quot;  In other words, John connected himself to his Samoan ancestors by scarring himself in the manner in which they might have made themselves look.</P>
<P>&#9;  John’s wife had claim to a chieftanship, but she gave this title to her husband, instead.  Perhaps she viewed the honor of being married to a matai higher than the honor of being a matai herself, but we cannot be sure.  John sponsored a ceremony in Los Angeles, where he became a matai, but he later found out that some of his Samoan relatives did not recognize his title unless the ceremony was performed in their village on the island of Samoa itself.  A good portion of the movie documents John’s journey and details his &quot;authentic&quot; ceremony, where he eventually becomes a recognized chief. The title of the movie, &quot;A Chief in Two Worlds&quot; comes from John’s struggle between his desire to remain Samoan and his desire to maintain the distance between himself and  Samoa.  These traits are demonstrative of a transnational culture, in which one exists in two societies simultaneously.  In this case, John exists in the Samoan society of subsistence farming and of American capitalism at the same time.</P>
<P>&#9;One way in which John demonstrates his cultural separateness is through his matai ceremony.  A Samoan resident becoming a matai would weave mats and raise an animal to slaughter for the feast following the ceremony.  Since John does not weave mats and he did not bring a pig with him from America, he had to buy these items in Samoa.  In a sense he is buying his title, in that he came over with a pocket full of money, and left as a chief with empty pockets.</P>
<P>&#9;The traditional Samoan language is spoken in the matai ceremony.  John gives a speech in his native tongue and the participants all speak Samoan as well.  The use of the native language in the ceremony creates a degree of authenticity as well as keeping with the tradition of using the native language on special occasions.  John’s ability to speak the indigenous language contributes to his Samoan identity by showing his desire to perform the ceremony in the traditional manner.  His sincere desire to become a chief is demonstrated ceremonial address.  This speech was a difficult obstacle for him to overcome, not only because he was speaking in his native language, but because of his inexperience in public speaking!  This ceremonial demonstration of language symbolizes John’s good intentions by showing that he will attempt difficult feats in order to become recognized by his Samoan community.</P>
<P>&#9;John is able to display his status in Samoa by bringing gifts to the attendees of his ceremony.  Money and woven mats are distributed as a symbol of John’s conspicuous ownership as well as an incentive for the residents of the village to attend his ceremony.  Leis woven from banknotes were passed around, and money was put in coconuts and handed out to a chief to begin the ceremony.  It is interesting to note that the bills that the leis were made from were American banknotes, and not made from Samoan currency.</P>
<P>&#9;The whole village must be present in a matai ceremony in order for the title to be valid, and the ceremony was almost canceled because of a few members reluctance to grant a matai to an outsider.  These stragglers ostracized John by their  In the end the villagers held a kind of talking circle, where the angry villagers were able to confront John in the traditional Samoan manner.  After their concerns were voiced and worked through, these few dissidents agreed to the attend and validate the ceremony.</P>
<P>&#9;John simultaneously lived in the urban jungle of Los Angeles and in the tropical island climate of Samoa.  The urban environment of Los Angeles provided John with a well paying job while at the same time distancing him from his homeland.  Samoa, on the other hand, is a lush tropical island  in which most of the residents rely on subsistence farming.  The same forces that bind Samoan families together can also drive them apart.  Tautooa, or humble service to family and chiefs, can motivate some to work for their family in Samoa, or more commonly these days, to leave the village, become educated, and help their families by sending them financial assistance.  A young boy questioned in the film stated &quot;I want to go overseas and earn money to send home.&quot;  This quote demonstrates how Samoan children sometimes choose capitalism over the traditional Samoan way of life.  John says that he would like the freedom that  subsistence farming brings, but obviously not enough to give up his urban lifestyle.  He continues to work in America and send a portion of his earnings to laborers in Samoa who farm and care for his land.  John hoped that his property in Samoa would benefit his children in the future, but he was unable to take care of it himself.</P>
<P>&#9;John’s title was given to him by his Samoan wife.  Titles are bestowed by descent groups, or in this case, from John’s wife’s family.  This chiefdom is an inherited position brought about by lineage.  In Samoan society, a chief is normally male, but it is possible for a woman to become a chief.  John’s wife had the claim to become a matai, but she gave this honor to her husband instead.  Perhaps the honor of being married to matai exceeded the honor of being one herself.  Maybe she knew how important that becoming a matai was to John, but in any case, she passed along her right to become a chief to her husband instead of becoming one herself.  </P>
<P>&#9;John’s simultaneous participation in two cultures provides many examples of what culture is and how culture manifests itself.  He worked in a factory in Los Angeles in order to send some of his money to his relatives in Samoa, not only to ensure his land was cared for , but to demonstrate his benevolence and membership in his traditional society.  His obligation to care for his Samoan community members, his tautooa, is demonstrated through his gifts of money and his leadership in the Los Angeles Samoan community as well.  Thus the Samoan concept of tautooa was brought to America by John, and one culture affected another.  John’s values are shaped to care for his family, both extended and nuclear.  He demonstrates this value in a capitalist society by having a laborers job, with which he gains the means to assist himself and his family.  He is too tied into American society to uproot and move to Samoa to become a subsistence farmer.  He would have to give up his car, his home, his children’s American education, and his friends if he were to relocate to Samoa.  Instead, John Hunkin decides to exist in both cultures the best he can, switching from one set of norms, values, and beliefs to another as he crosses international borders.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;John’s participation in two cultures makes the differences between the two visible and comparable.  The ideas, beliefs, knowledge, behavior, customs, and way of life are not always demonstrated consistently by John, depending on which culture he finds himself in a given moment.  These distinctions in behavior allow us an insight into what is expected of a member of a particular culture.  These discrepancies allow us to accurately analyze a culture in light of another, as well examine individual components of culture that may not be observable using other methods.</P>
