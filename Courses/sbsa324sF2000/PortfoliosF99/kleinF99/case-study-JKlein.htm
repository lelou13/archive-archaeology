<P>&#9;For my mid-term deliverable I will enumerate the components, uses, strengths, and weaknesses of the case study method as a research method.</P>
<P>&#9;A case study attempts to create a comprehensive analysis of a case or of multiple cases.  In other words, a case study is used to answer &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot; questions. The case study method is a useful tool to investigate how or why a phenomenon occurs. This study requires detailed information from many sources in order to achieve a more holistic understanding of the problem. A case study is &quot;an exploration of a bounded system (Creswell, 61).&quot;  A case study is bounded because it is limited by time and place.  Boundaries must be set up so that a particular phenomenon is observable.  Time, place, and processes all help the researcher define clear beginning and end points of a study.  </P>
<P>&#9;There are several different types of case studies, determined by its relation to the issue being studied.  Intrinsic case studies are studied because an internal trait particular to that case requires a deeper understanding.  An instrumental case study demonstrates an issue, while a collective case study occurs when more than one case is studied.  Case studies can study either singular or multiple phenomena.  A multi-site study may study an event at several locations, while a within-site study would examine a singular event.</P>
<P>&#9;Explanatory case studies are used when the &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot; of a situation is main line of inquiry of a study.  These studies explain &quot;which causes have which effects(Yin, 5).&quot;  A descriptive case study provides a comprehensive portrayal of a phenomenon within its context.  When literature on a topic is scarce the exploratory case study is frequently implemented, in part to investigate the feasibility of subsequent studies.  Exploratory case studies often focus on defining terms and questions for other studies.     </P>
<P>&#9;A case study begins with the statement of a problem; what it is and why it needs to be studied.  The purpose statement follows the statement of the problem, this purpose describes the desired outcomes of the study as well as the pathways to be utilized.  The purpose statement generally includes the specific tradition of inquiry to be used and the central focus of the study is defined.  The research questions can be divided into a central questions and subquestions.  The central question is generally all encompassing, open-ended and restates the purpose of the study.  Subquestions delve deeper into the line of inquiry brought about by the central question.  Subquestions can be thought of in two categories, issue subquestions and topical subquestions.  Issue subquestions are not easily answered, they must involve norms, values, and beliefs of a group or individual in relation to an event or organization.  Topical subquestions focus on data collection by asking questions that &quot;call for information needed for the description of the case (Creswell, 101).&quot;  These questions are designed to gather information in an organized fashion about a unit of analysis particular to a study.</P>
<P>&#9;The unit of analysis in a case study has traditionally been an individual person.  Groups of people, organizations, key decisions, public programs, and organizational change can all be units of analysis in a case study as well.  It is important to define your unit of analysis because a nebulous definition will make it difficult to limit the boundaries of your case.  Case studies allow researchers to observe phenomena in its natural setting, unlike an experiment, which is an artificial reconstruction of social life.  &quot;Case studies enable the investigator to ground the observations and concepts with which she or he works (Orum, Feagin, Sjoberg, 7).&quot;  These circumstances are conducive to studying individuals in their natural environment.  An application of the case study in this sense would be to study gangs in a particular city or Hispanic families in an urban environment.  Case study methods are also applicable when individual motivations and circumstances are investigated.  An ideal situation for the case method would be to understand why a group of people acted the way they did during a turbulent event in their lives.  </P>
<P>Data collection is the next stage in the case study.  A case study gathers data from sources including documentation, archival records, interviews, direct observations, participant observations, and physical artifacts.  Ideally, information is collected from as many sources as possible in order to provide for a more whole study.  Data triangulation, the use of three sources of data to show corroboratory evidence, adds validity to a study and can be created by comprehensive data collection.  After sufficient data has been collected, it must be analyzed and interpreted.  A narrative report consisting of conclusions and outcomes concludes the study.  </P>
<P>&#9;Case study data can be collected from many sources of evidence.  Documentation, archival records, interviews, direct observations, participant observations, and physical artifacts make up the majority of these sources.  Documentation can help the researcher validate information gained from other sources, but care must be taken to watch for potential bias of the author and to be aware of inaccuracies.  Archival records are not imperative to every case study and generally consist of computerized files.  Archives may consist of lists, records, and surveys.  Interviews are typically open-ended when dealing with the case study method, however &quot;...interview data must be understood as verbal reports only (Yin, 247).&quot;   Interview questions can also reflect the bias of the researcher, so care must be taken when constructing interview questions.  Direct observations are taken by making a visit to the site of the case study, and are only relevant to contemporary issues.  That is to say, the further back that an event happened, the less useful your direct observations from the field will be.  Participant observation occurs when a researcher interacts with the subject of study while at the same time making observations.  Participant observation is best suited for collecting data concerning private or illegal behavior that other data collection methods may have misreported or overlooked.  Physical artifacts are instruments, devices, and tools used as evidence in a case study.  However, limited availability of artifacts can be a drawback to using physical artifacts.</P>
<P>&#9;After the data has been collected, it must be organized into an easily accessible database.  It is important to organize this information because it reduces the distortion between the data and the interpretation of the data.  Case study methods data can be organized by topic, question, or the chronology of case method protocol.  If the information is stored on a computer, than certain programs may be used to search and organize your database using words, strings or phrases.  Developing a hard-copy diagram of your information and the techniques used to acquire it can also be a beneficial research tool.  </P>
<P>&#9;Analysis of a case study consists of a comprehensive description of the case and its features. Four types of data analysis can help the researcher, these methods are categorical aggregation, direct interpretation, patterns, and naturalistic generalizations.  A researcher using categorical aggregation draws meaning from multiple instances of an event or phenomena.  Direct interpretation occurs when the researcher looks at a singular occurrence of an event or phenomena.  Analyzing the relationship between two or more categories uses the &quot;pattern&quot; method of data analysis.  Naturalistic generalizations are connections that people make about the population in general or about other cases using that particular case study as an example.  </P>
<P>&#9;Three other methods of analyzing case study data are pattern matching, explanation building, and time series analysis.  In pattern matching, a researcher compares and contrasts &quot;an empirically based pattern with an existing one (Yin, 251).&quot;  Examining data collected for a case and checking to see if they occur in a logical sequence that begets the case’s outcome is one example of explanation building.  When multiple cases are being studied, explanation building helps analyze different sets of data together, a kind of cross-case analysis.  Time series analysis is typically used when there is a wide variety of data with different chronological sequences.  </P>
<P>&#9;Case study methodology has inherent strengths and limitations. Case studies are useful when attempting to understand individual behavior or thought processes .  Case studies provide an in-depth inquiry into a specific example of a broader phenomenon.  Case studies are often linked to ethnographies, in that first person accounts and observations are useful in gathering data.  These first person accounts by the researcher allow him to experience the phenomenon being studied and allows greater insight into the case.  Many sources of information covering an extended period of time allow the researcher a more complete study of difficult concepts and relationships pertinent to the case.   Case studies enable the researcher to grasp &quot;a sense of time and history (Orum &amp; Feagin &amp; Sjoberg, 12)&quot; by making it possible to view patterns of social life and history over a period of time.  Whereas statistical research tends to &quot;prove&quot; theories, case study research begets theories.  This trait of creating new theories through observation and data analyzation is another strength of the case method.  </P>
<P>&#9;Typically, the case study method should not be used when statistical data required because case studies tend to focus on a specific example of an event, and not the event as it would be statistically guaranteed to occur.  Criticism of the case study method comes from those who say that a researcher’s bias limits the validity of a study, and that working with numerical data is the only way to remain removed from the subject being studied.   Some ideological frameworks view this inability to remain objective as a limitation of the case study.  The issue of reliability is another potential disadvantage to the use of the case study method.  This means that two separate researchers working independently of each other may reach two separate conclusions based on the same data.  On the other hand, two separate identical inquiries using quantitative methods are likely to come up with the same results.</P>
<P>&#9;Holistic explanations require that you are familiar with a case and it’s features, that you have &quot;covered all the bases.&quot;  When conducting a case study, one is likely to ensure a holistic interpretation of the data by bounding the research topic and investigating it in great depth.  Gathering data from a wide variety of sources in order to triangulate data can ensure a valid interpretation and accurate results.  For example, if one were studying the closure of a former military base, triangulation of the data sources could be accomplished by interviewing those affected by the closure, observing the individuals involved, the base itself, and by reviewing any media newscasts, articles or testimonials relevant to the base closure.  By incorporating both emic and etic viewpoints, a researcher is likely to accurately interpret events having contextual meaning to the phenomena being studied. Having a holistic explanation of the data enables an accurate representation of the results, and helps limit bias that might come from using fewer research angles or methods.</P>
<P>&#9;The case study consists of several different parts, including a problem, a purpose, data collection, analyzation of the data, and a narrative report.  It is used to gain an in-depth view at a person’s social life or to examine a broad phenomenon in detail.  A holistic and carefully though out case study can be an example of &quot;good science&quot; and become a stepping stone for further social science researchers.</P>
