<P>&#9;My archaeological project for the Fall 1999 semester has been the excavation of Mission San Juan Bautista.  We have been looking for the foundation of a part of the mission that was demolished long ago.  Our search has been hampered by the numerous plowings and tillings that have occurred over the years.  Additionally, no one knows where this part of the mission previously existed.   Although we were unsuccessful in finding this foundation, the experience was a success as far as my experience with the tools and techniques of archaeology are concerned.</P>
<P>&#9;Dr. Mendoza's method of excavation consisted of removing the soil in 20 centimeter deep layers.  Materials found in these layers would be catalogued together, at least in the sense that they shared a similar layer.  I spent a lot of time in the N10W38SW1/4 sector.  Sometimes the digging went quickly, when there were two people alternating digging and sifting.  Other times, the process went quite slowly when there were various objects pedestalled within the sector.  Finding items in the soil was quite exciting.  Even finding a small shard of discarded pottery was exciting.  Perhaps this would be because the alternative, finding nothing, is what we did most of the time.  There were several false alarms when we thought that we had found an ancient burial ground or underground tunnel.  This speculation was the fun part of the excavation, because you never knew what you would find or where you would find it.  Even when someone else found something exciting, it was encouraging because they are part of your group with similar objectives.</P>
<P>&#9;Interpersonal relations where strained and made during these visits to the mission.  This is a skill that many people need to learn, and there were moments of the visits that were strained with the tension of working with those with different perspectives and opinions.  For the most part it was quite enjoyable to work with other students to come to further a common objective.</P>
<P>&#9;Through this experience I learned about material construction techniques of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century.  Tile, ceramic, and glass were found in my sector and explanations of their techniques were given.  For example, different kinds of tile were found, some charred, some baked to what I think is a harder consistency.  Different firing temperatures for ceramics contribute to a different final product, and different decoration techniques were used on different shards that were found.  I found a shard of a wine bottle that I found out was hand-blown glass.  What luck that we don't have to go through this ordeal for wine today.  Or perhaps I should say, "it's a shame that we don't go through this ordeal today."  Perhaps then mass consumerism might not be the dominant worldview and causation of many problems.  </P>
<P>&#9;I enjoyed learning about a way of life that existed before mine.  This was of primary interest to me while excavating at Mission San Juan Bautista.  Learning about beads that were used for exchange before our modern currency has made me long for a system of barter where one dictated medium controls all exchanges.  Adobe walls and tile fragments must have made cold winters a common occurrence; far from my experience with heaters and electric blankets when a chill arises.  I have wondered if I am lucky to benefit from these modern conveniences, or unlucky to be a slave to them.  There is something romantic about living before modern conveniences.  Perhaps this is my privilege as an enfranchised citizen to speculate on the benefits of technological infancy.  Nevertheless, I would enjoy living in an pre-industrial society for a time in order to gain a better appreciation of the conveniences that I enjoy every day.  From typing this paper to driving home for Christmas, the modern tools that cut work and maximize leisure are inseparable from me in my daily life.  I would speculate that technology serves this purpose no matter what the time period.  Dr. Mendoza and the Mission San Juan Bautista excavation can teach students important lessons about archaeology, architecture, Spanish colonialism, and culture.  These lessons are an important part of becoming a well rounded student prepared for lifelong learning in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.  </P></BODY>
