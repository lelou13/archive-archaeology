</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>California missions involved colonization</P>
<P>&#9;Colonization often included violence toward native populations</P>
<P>Indians received benefits of protection and meals, pots and pants, upward mobility</P>
<P>Many communities were subjected to this process against their will</P>
<P>Leading to forced acculturation-religion, education, etc.</P>
<P>In Texas and Arizona, the Spanish colonists brutally responded to Apache raids</P>
<P>Spanish would often place heads outside their presidio complexes that were there to "secure the frontier"</P>
<P>Protect against incursions by the British and the French, led to establishments of military provinces (Monterey was area 5)</P>
<P>Santa Barbara has state of the art archive (difficult to use)</P>
<P>1816 the padres dealt with raids and earthquakes in San Juan</P>
<P>&#9;neophytes being attacked by outsiders (living and acting like outsiders)</P>
<P>&#9;presidio soldiers taking out anger on Native Americans</P>
<P>father arroyo de la Cuesta lived at the mission for nearly 30 years</P>
<P>&#9;learned the native language, linguist</P>
<P>&#9;eccentric (named Indian children after Greek philosophers)</P>
<P>&#9;invented a water clock</P>
<P>&#9;ill- all but incapacitated when he started at the mission, perhaps advanced arthritis</P>
<P>&#9;many doctors would come to the mission and try to help his pain</P>
<P>&#9;many frustrations regarding the Spanish government</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;letters to Monterey that the governor release Indian prisoners</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;release Tiburcio Vasquez, the gentleman bandit</P>
<P>Father Toppes came in later and stayed at the mission until 1825</P>
<P>In 1816 there was a revolution in Mexico</P>
<P>&#9;Letters were pledging or conversely, not pledging allegiance</P>
<P>Lists with orders to Mexico with wish lists of tobacco, goods, etc. are in archive</P>

<P>In the Sonoran desert</P>
<P>Mission San Xavier Del Bac</P>
<P>Construction stops in 1797, ranchers are denied Franciscan priests</P>
<P>Not long after, Mexico wins her independence</P>
<P>The laborers who built the mission divide and guard the mission</P>
<P>In 1912, missionaries return to the mission</P>
<P>Weather beats at the mission, crumbling paint and melting bricks</P>
<P>Financing repair is difficult "separation of church and state"</P>
<P>In 1978, a non profit organization founded to preserve the mission and I would guess acquire funding</P>
<P>"putting a hard face on a soft building speeds erosion"</P>
<P>cement is enemy of the church because it retains moisture</P>
<P>juice of cactus, san, lime slate and water creates a mortar that was originally used</P>
<P>paintings are being restored by a group of artists requiring 3 months work for 6 years</P>
<P>one technique-moisten paint, adhere it to wall</P>
<P>Commandant of the Tucson presidio said the decorated the mission in order to impress the Indians</P>
<P>Evidence suggests the artists came from central Mexico</P>
<P>Combination of architecture and art was the only-two punch to the neophytes</P>
<P>Perhaps a Marian (virgin Mary) shrine and examples of mysticism/scholasticism</P>
<P>In 1994, another mural appears in the west wing</P>
<P>&#9;With founding Franciscan monks on the bottom, Christ/Mary on the top</P>
<P>Three day celebration-feast for San Francisco Xavier feast, then sundown, then procession where the statue is carried out of the mission and into the village</P>
<P>Graffiti from the past 150 years is eliminated, and a new altar is finished</P></FONT></BODY>
