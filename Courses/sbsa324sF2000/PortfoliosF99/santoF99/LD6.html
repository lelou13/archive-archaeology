<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was impressed by the way that many different
tools could be made from just one piece of material. Unlike today where
we have a different knife for every different thing imaginable and they
are all made from different items, the people who used stone tools recycled
the broken tools and made new ones each time a new task was set upon them.
Once the tool broke instead of throwing it away and starting all over again
they just chipped more away and used it again for something else. They
just reshaped the tool to perform any kind of work that needed to be done.
Many people believe that the people from thousands of years ago were not
as intelligent as people of today. But I feel that they were very intelligent.
They were able to make tools from hunks of rock with their bare hands.
They also used the tool until there was nothing left but some flakes. When
the edge got dull, they sharpened it; when the spear point broke, they
reshaped it to use again and again. Unlike today where if something is
broke and can not be fixed it is thrown away. I was also intrigued by the
way that he could predict the way that the flake would come off. He could
get exactly the shape he wanted by hitting the rock in just the right way.
There is a use of physics involved in flintknapping. The toolmaker needs
to know how the rock is going to break, and that comes from experience
and experimentation. Once they know how the rock will break and what tools
and techniques make it break a certain way then they can make tools with
little or no effort because they know just how to hit it. It was interesting
to see the different techniques used in the toolmaking. It was also interesting
to see the different tools being used. I was able to see exactly how they
worked and what kind of flakes they produced.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately I was unable to attend class
last Thursday because I was ill. From what I understand it was a really
interesting lab. From the previous lab I observed the amount of knowledge
you must have about the material and the tool you are making. It takes
a lot of practice to know just how to hit the stone in order for it to
break just right. I hope that I will have a chance to go to another lab
to work with stone tools in the future.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Courtney and I spent the time in the lab
preparing for our Garbology lab.&nbsp; We formed our primary questionnaire,
picking our subjects, and discussing a schedule so we did not perform the
labs.&nbsp; The last lab we spent the time going through the samples that
we had collected.&nbsp; That is why my piece on Stone Tools is short and
rather incomplete.</font>
