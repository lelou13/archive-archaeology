<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">I would assume that the items found would
tell a lot about the people and the culture of the area. The chert core
for flaking stone tools show that the area was one where they made things.
It was possibly a work area, rather than a living area. The Spanish colonial
trade bead made of red glass could mean that the area was also used to
trade things. The bovine or capra tooth could mean the livestock was kept
near there. All three items together could mean that the area was a market
place that housed a tool laker, a trading post, and livestock areas.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Material Culture 2</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/8/99</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. There is a figure of a man wearing a
full jaguar or ocelot costume. He has feathers on the back of his head
and he is holding a staff with what looks like flames on the top. He could
be a priest or possibly a jaguar knight. He has large ear pieces with ornaments
dangling from the circle. The jaguar or ocelot costume combined with the
ear pieces, it is evident that he is very high in status. He is an important
figure in the tribe.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. There is also a figure of a man wearing
an eagle headdress. That was the only person I saw with the eagle headdress.
The eagle is connected with the heavens, therefore it is my contention
that he is connected to the church and is possibly a priest. He is definitely
of high status, the eagle was a sacred symbol and not just anyone could
wear it.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. On one panel there were three symbols
which looked like a modern day compass. In the line the symbol was above
the other drawings. It could have been a calendar or sundial, but it had
points that seemed to mark N, S, E, and W.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. There was also the figure of a man with
a jaguar or ocelot headdress and one hand was missing and the other was
like the paw of a large cat. He has both nose and ear pieces, and a beard.
He was the only one I saw with a beard. The other images were of clean-shaven
men. It is my impression that he is of high status. He has several articles
that give me the idea that he is high in status.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">5. There was another man with a jaguar headdress
and one hand was a paw instead of a hand. He also seemed to be wearing
armor. He could be a jaguar knight. He seemed to be a fighter, with the
armor and the paw for a hand.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">6. There was also the image of a carcass
of, I believe an animal that was spread out and the skin was separated
from the bones. You could see the bones lying in the middle of the skin.
It was like the way the skins of animals were dried out to use for clothing
and other things. It could be showing their practice of using all parts
of the animals.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Material Culture 3</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/10/99</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first artifacts I received were very
different. The first one is brownish red in color and roughly 1.5" - 2"
in length. Side A is fairly smooth, but it has been worked to form sharp
edges. There are very few hard edges, where flaking has occurred on the
face, and there is a peak in the center that slopes to the edges. The edges
are smooth for the most part. It appears that the tip is missing and the
bottom has one large notch opposite the point. Side B is smooth except
for one small area that appears to be broke off a large rock. This side
doesn't appear to have been worked. It resembles the Archaic Humbolt Basal-notch
(b), 7,850 - 2,500 B.P. This piece might have been used for a spear point,
or as a hand-held cutting tool. The second artifact is gray in color over
the majority of it except for a small area on the left side of the base,
which is red/pink. It is roughly 1" - 1.25" in length. The flaking appears
to be done in the all directions, and it appears to be fairly asymmetrical.
The edges are rough, like a serrated knife. There are grooves on the sides
near the base for the tie to go around when assembling a spear or arrow.
It resembles Late Plains Archaic Kobold Site (a) 3,100 - 1,400 B.P. The
two pieces are different in almost all ways.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/15/99</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Artifact 1.10 The artifact I looked at was
many different colors. The colors were 5yr 6/1, 7/1, &amp; 7/2. The prominent
color was 6/1, a pinkish gray, was mainly the center and one side. On the
base the main color is 7/1 a lighter gray, less pink. On the other edge
the main color is 7/2 which is a lighter gray with more pink.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Material Culture 5</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/15/99</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Artifact 1.10: both sides a and b are secondary
and show some cortex. Most of the cortex is on the proximal end, and the
distal end is rounded and leads to cerated edges. The flaking appears to
have been done on both sides, but much of the attention was on the edges.</font>
