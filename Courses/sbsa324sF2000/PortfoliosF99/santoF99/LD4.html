<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Site Grid: Archaeologists stake and line
full squares starting from the datum point, and it makes the grid permanent.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Datum: A fixed reference point for the excavation
making the mapping procedure easier and also giving people the same point
of perspective. Also when someone goes back months later they can find
exactly what the others had noted, and therefore no confusion is made between
different archaeologists.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sampling Strategy: Archaeologists sample
and excavate various small units within a larger unit to determine whether
there is anything of importance in the area. They can then determine whether
it is worth the time, the money, and the effort to excavate any further
or to move onto another site.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Soil Analysis: Archaeologists take a soil
sample and analyze the composition of it to determine of there was human
habitation there.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
