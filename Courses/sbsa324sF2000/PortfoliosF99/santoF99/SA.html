<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This semester has allowed
me to look at the field of Archeology from within.&nbsp; Since I was a
little girl when I visited many Native American ruins I was interested
in the field of Archaeology and everything that goes into it.&nbsp; Through
this class I was able to see just the beginning of what archaeology really
entails.&nbsp; I was intrigued by the different labs and the lectures about
all the different places Professor Mendoza had been.&nbsp; I really enjoyed
the lecture about the Anastazi and the ruins located in the Southwest.&nbsp;
I visited them when I was about 10 years old and I will never forget what
I saw.&nbsp; Most people have no idea what I am talking about when I mention
the Anastazi, so I was glad to see someone else who had been there and
knew what I was talking about.&nbsp; I was also given the opportunity to
try a new type of study called Garbology.&nbsp; It is a relatively new
method of studying a culture and habits through rubbish and refuse.&nbsp;
I am also glad to have this opportunity to reflect on the semester as a
whole and be able to look back at what I have learned and how it has affected
me.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stated in my Midterm
Self-Assessment I am extremely excited to be able to take this class.&nbsp;
It allows me to explore a section of Social Science that has intrigued
me for many years.&nbsp; I know that I am lucky that this university offers
this class.&nbsp; Many of my friends who attend other universities envy
me and I am glad that I took advantage of that opportunity.&nbsp; When
I first came to this school, three years ago, I saw this course listed
on an ULR sheet in my Proseminar class and I knew that I would take it
before I left this university.&nbsp; It was an added bonus that this course
fulfilled part of my science ULR.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This semester I have looked
at Material Cultures and the study of past civilizations through the remains
of their possessions and trash; the study of stone tool making; and Garbology.&nbsp;
Material Cultures and Garbology sections of the class were the ones that
I was most interested in.&nbsp; I like the Material Cultures section because
it showed how archaeologists look at the remains left my people and determine
the habits and aspects of their lives.&nbsp; The study of the Anastazi
is similar in that archaeologists are studying the ruins in the hope of
finding out what happened to the people who suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;
I liked the videos and lectures that explained many different processes
that archaeologists use in the study of past civilizations.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as Garbology is
concerned I was curious as to what you can learn from people’s garbage.&nbsp;
I was curious as to how much about a person you can learn from their garbage,
and that if your assumptions would prove to be correct or not.&nbsp; My
partner and I decided early in the semester that our final project would
be on Garbology.&nbsp; We chose to study our peers.&nbsp; We chose two
dorm room, one with two girls and the other with two boys.&nbsp; We wanted
to look at whether or not our stereotypes of a male and female college
student were correct.&nbsp; We made assumptions as to what we would find
in the beginning and the plan is to see if any of them were correct.&nbsp;
We made the hypothesis that the boys would eat more fast food and drink
more alcohol that the girls; and that the girls would eat more healthy
food than the boys would.&nbsp; For the most part we were correct, there
were many wrappers from fast food in the boys garbage, and there were lots
of fruit remnants and yogurt in the girls trash.&nbsp; We were not totally
surprised by this finding, but we didn’t expect almost everything to be
correct.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;I am really glad that I took this course.&nbsp;
I am glad that I have had a chance to take a peek into the field of Archaeology.&nbsp;
I was able to see that it is more like a hobby than a future career.&nbsp;
I liked the different labs and everything, but I came to learn that deep
down I am a film person.&nbsp; I would however like to incorporate Archaeology
into my filmmaking, by perhaps, doing documentaries on the Anastazi and
other lost civilizations.&nbsp; No one know what the future holds for me,
but I will definitely keep what I have learned in this course in my mind
for future film projects.</font>
