<br>SBSA 224s/324s
<br>Professor Mendoza
<br>October 15,1999
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I enrolled in SBSA 224s/324s to full-fill upper division HCOM concentration
requirement. HCOM doesn’t have many history classes and I always wanted
to learn more about the role archaeology in relation to the social sciences.
During high school, I thought I would choose archaeology as a profession.
However, my life took another direction. After many years working in the
corporate world, I returned as a re-entry student to pursue my passion
for history. CSUMB doesn’t have a history major, so I have tried to take
classes that taught some sort of history. Professor Mendoza’s archaeology
class was recommended because the class included archaeology and the history
of ancient Mezzo-America and other early Native-American cultures.
<p>Another objective I had in this class would be to work at the San Juan
Bautista Mission. I wanted to learn first hand how to do field excavations
and analysis of Hispanic colonial artifacts at the Old Mission. The field
excavations full-fill the service learning requirement at CSUMB. Even though
I have already met this requirement through HCOM, I wanted to learn more
about the San Juan Bautista Mission. I have visited almost all of the California
Missions because I wanted to learn more about California early history.
Overall, I would say that my objectives for taking this class have been
met and I know understand more about the role archaeology plays in understanding
and preserving history for future generations.
<p>I have participated in the entire Lab and Field Deliverables, with the
exception of October 7<sup>th</sup> stone tool lab. The work I have completed
in the Lab and Field Deliverables has helped to understand and grasp key
archaeology concepts and to apply them in the lab and at San Juan Bautista
Mission. Most importantly, I think using the hands on approach in the lab,
has helped me to understand how stone tools were made and used. The lab
work has been easy for me because I have been using the same excavation
methods at the San Juan Mission. Thus far, we have only worked on stone
tools at the lab; I am looking forward to learning about garbology. As
far as the Field Option at San Juan Bautista, I have excavated at the mission
five times. The work has been a little dirty; however, I have enjoyed doing
hands on excavation work there.
<p>I have used the Online Journal to post my thoughts after each class
and after each Field Option at the mission. Each of my journals reflects
my understanding of that day’s lecture and this process has helped me to
understand what archaeology is about. Professor Mendoza has lectured and
shown many interesting slides that covered ancient civilizations. I feel
that it is helpful to journal what I have learned in class, the writing
process helps to the student not only document what they have learned.
I am satisfied with my comments to the questions posted on the On Line
Journal. My journal entries were posted in depth pertaining to the five
Lab Deliverables thus far, and daily class lectures were written during
class in depth.
<p>I have chosen the Field Option of excavation over the writing of a term
project. Working on the excavation at San Juan Bautista has helped me to
understand how the "scientific method" is used in archaeology to layout,
identification, and excavation of archaeological sites. The on-site field
excavations have given me a sense of what life was like at the mission.
I have been able to excavate and document artifacts that I have found at
the site. I have learned how to record information about the artifacts
such as, how to do insitu measurements, weighing, height and length, classification,
and how to dry/wet shift excavation dirt within the quarter. Professor
Mendoza has explained how the site was laid out and why the site was chosen.
Different archaeology tools were introduced at the site.
<p>I enjoyed many of the Lab and Field Deliverables, thus far. All of the
lab and field deliverables have given me a better understanding about archaeology.
The lab and field deliverables I enjoyed the most have been Excavation
Methods Review, Stone Tool Analysis, Archaeology Video Review, and working
at the field excavation. I have enjoyed working at the mission the most.
My recommendation for improvement in this section would be to have a little
more explanation about the lab material. Maybe more class discussion and
group work. Otherwise, I think the content and type of Lab and Field Deliverables
is comprehensive. Because I have an interest in American history, I would
like to see other ancient tribes through out America included.
<p>Finally, I plan on asking more questions in class; sometimes speaking
up in class is hard for me. I would like to learn more about the process
of making stone tools. Keeping up with the reading will be another goal…my
primary strength in class has been my excavation work at the mission, and
hands on work in the lab. I enjoy hands on work over sitting at computer.
Although I do enjoy computer research on historic buildings and their history.
Another strength I have in this class is that I know how to apply the methods,
concepts, and practices of field archaeology and how they are applied in
understanding ancient and modern cultures. Some of the methods and theory
I have learned in class, I have used at the San Juan Bautista Mission.
At first, I didn’t know what I was doing at the excavation site, and then
I learned more each time I went to the mission. Now I feel much more comfortable
working at the site. Also, the most important concept I have learned about
archaeology is that "the present can be seen to "serve the past," it is
important to understand and preserve these ancient cultures for future
generations before they are lost forever…
