<p><b>Final Self Assessment</b>
<p>&nbsp;I have fulfilled my objectives in SBSA 224/324S that will satisfy
the HCOM upper division concentration requirement.&nbsp; I decided to enroll
in Dr. Mendoza’s class because HCOM doesn’t have many history classes that
I am interested in taking.&nbsp; Dr. Mendoza’s archaeology class covers
a period in history that I am interested in.&nbsp; We covered historical
information about Mezzo-America and other early Native American cultures.&nbsp;
After completing this class, I have a better understanding about the early
Aztec and Mayan culture in Mexico and how these cultures left a lasting
imprint upon the world of history. I intend to use the material I have
learned in this class within my senior capstone.&nbsp; I’m not sure yet
what my capstone will encompass, but I hope to research Native-American
culture in the Southwest.
<p>&nbsp;In addition, this class introduced the methods, principals, and
practices of field archaeology by using exercises that stress strategy,
interpretation, description, information management, archaeological technologies,
and the role of scientific inquiry in the human sciences. I completed Major
Deliverables in class and in the labs on Thursdays.&nbsp; I also completed
all of the Lithics (Stone tools) labs. The Lithics lab introduced the hands-on
manufacture and use of stone tools and the ancient and modern material
cultures.&nbsp; Within these labs, I learned what it must have been like
to work and make different forms of raw material (mainly obsidian) into
stone tools.&nbsp; The work was fun and gave me a challenge.&nbsp; Towards
the end of the Lithics Lab, the class was instructed to make three types
of stone tools.&nbsp; At first, I thought that I would not be able to turn
my piece of obsidian into anything.&nbsp; However, with determination,
I was able to produce a cutting tool, scrapper, and an arrowhead.
<br>&nbsp;I have enjoyed many of the Lab and Field Deliverables.&nbsp;
Given that I am suppose to give a final assessment whether or not I have
meet my objectives; I would say that I have improved and completed all
of the assignments.&nbsp; One of my objectives was to discuss with Dr.
Mendoza why I couldn’t arrive to class until about 8:15.&nbsp; I had mentioned
in mid term self assessment that I thought more explanation about the in
class lab material was needed.&nbsp; However, Dr. Mendoza covered this
material when the class first started.&nbsp; I did discuss the problem
I was having getting to class at 8:00.&nbsp; I am a single parent which
leaves I am the one who has to commute my daughter to school each day.&nbsp;
My daughter starts school around 8:00 so I wasn’t able to arrive then.&nbsp;
Also, I thought I had discussed this problem with Dr. Mendoza in the beginning
of the semester.&nbsp; This was an over site on my part.
<p>&nbsp;In addition, I started to ask more questions in class; speaking
up in class has always been difficult for me.&nbsp; I find that I able
to speak up more when I am in small groups or with people that I feel comfortable
with.
<br>&nbsp;Keeping up with the class readings was another goal, I did keep
up with the readings and I finished all of the assigned readings within
the textbook and the class handouts.&nbsp; The reading and the handouts
helped to clear up any questions and the reading material helped to reinforce
the archaeological material that was covered in class.
<br>&nbsp;The most important objective I have completed is working on the
archaeology dig at the San Juan Bautista Mission.&nbsp; I wanted to learn
first hand how to do field excavations and analysis of Hispanic colonial
artifacts at the Old Mission.&nbsp; The field excavations also fulfill
the service learning requirement in HCOM.&nbsp; Although I have already
meet this requirement, I wanted to learn more about the San Juan Bautista
Mission.&nbsp; I have visited almost all of the California Missions because
I wanted to learn more about California early history.
<br>&nbsp;Overall, I would say that my objectives for taking this class
have been met and I now have a better understanding about the role archaeology
plays in understanding and preserving history for future generations.&nbsp;
I have enjoyed Dr. Mendoza’s class and I would not suggest that anything
should be changed within the class content.
<p>&nbsp;Finally, I did not know what I was doing at the excavation site,
and now I have learned what is important and how work on excavation sites.&nbsp;
Furthermore, I would conclude the most important concept I have learned
about archaeology is that “the present can be seen to serve the past”,
it is important to understand and preserve these ancient cultures for future
generations before they are lost forever….
