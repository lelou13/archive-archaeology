<p><font size=+1>My method of choosing my samples and transects for each
step were very random. The first step was to pick ten grid squares that
would represent an area on the map that I would be interesting to look
at. In doing samples, U2, V6, U5, U7, S3, V8, G7, T5, T9, V3. These samples
draw out the region of the map. I thought this grids would the be most
interesting to dig up and research. The second step was to pick five transects
that would be of interest to me to study. I chose transect B, because going
down the hills it looked like it would have a lot of tribes. I chose T
because it looked like an area the people would have chose because it is
rich vertile land. I chose V because it contained the largest of the settlement.
I chose U for the same reason as T and it was short. The third step was
to choose ten grid squares on the basis of predicted settlement. I choose
the high area of the map because it had the river and rich vertile valley
areas that would be of value to the tribes to build their cities. I choose
B9, K13, W7, G8, L5, L9, V3, M8, V4, Q3. Also, I did choose some areas
on the bottom of the map because they were at the bottom of the river valley,
there might have been a water fall and lots of vegatation for food sources
and game to hunt. Finally, I choose a stratified sample of five grids squares
selected to factor out noise...areas included within the topigraphic areas,</font>
<br><font size=+1>everything else would be condiered factored out noise.
I choose K11, M10, L12, J13, L14.</font>

<p><font size=+1>Questions: 1)The primary "myths" of archaeology and the
moundbuilders noted in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; video were:
Early explorers and surveyors believed that the "mounds" could not of&nbsp;
been built by early Indain tribes because they were too unskilled. They
thought the mounds were bulit by an advanced civilization with better skills.
The early explores made started these myths based upon assumptions. The
explorers thought the Vikings and the Welch people when they explored this
area. In the late 1700's, white settlers found the first mounds in the
Ohio Valley. The settlers thought the mounds were built by the same ancient
tribes. They also thought the mounds were built by tribes passing through
on their way to Mexico. In 1860's, French explorers found that the mound
builders buried their dead in the center of the mounds. I believe the early
explorers did not look into possible other facts. They based their myths
upon assumptions without verfiying the data. Also, these myths were based
upon the research materials and&nbsp; beliefs that were prevelant during
this time period. They didn't have the advanced equipment archaeologists
have today. Finally, I do agree with the myth that the mounds built two
different ancient Indain cultures. 2) The "mound reconstruction"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
experiment undertaken by the archaeologists was important because most
of the mounds have been torn down by modern man. Before these mound are
gone completely, archaeologits want to doument the two cultures who buliut
the mounds. So that we can better understand how and why these mounds were
built by these ancient&nbsp; people. What happened when they migrated here
after the "ice age" and why they chose to build these mounds. The archaeologists
wanted to understand how the techniques and how long it took to build them.
The experiment helped to understand the two different cultures that built
these mounds(Hopewell and Miss. Culture, around Christ's time). The two
cultures built their mounds similar. During the experiment, archaeologists
rebuilt the mound in the same way they believe the Hopewell did. This would
explain what it was like to build the mounds. How, why, where they were
built.&nbsp; Finally, the researchers hoped to leave the mound for at least
feive years, so that they could excavate latter to record what they found.
3) The value and approach represented by the "salvage archaeology" was
done by early archeaologists who wanted to salvage the remaining mounds
and the artifacts that remained. Many of the</font>
<br><font size=+1>artifacts in the mounds were already taken by white settlers
to sell them at high prices for profit. Salvage Archaeology is done by
archaeolgist to put the mound builders myths to rest. Today, researchers
are studying the remaining mounds in Ohio valley.&nbsp; Campsville Center
was created to research the moundbuilders. Salvage archaeolgists study
the existing condition of the mounds. They look at the layers of the dirt
and how it was poured. Also, the remaing artifacts within the mound describe
their culture and how they used them. Since the Hopewell and Miss. cultures
existed ober 1000 year ago, excavating sites this way will help to perserve
and document their existance. This will help to understand the highly skilled
intelligence these cultures possessed. How they could have constructed
these great mounds with primitive tools. How they were able to organize
thier community to build the mounds. Also, this research will help archaeologists
understand the status of the families and people within these cultures.
How and why their argriculture changed due to corn and better nutrition.
Finally, "salvage archaeology" will dismantle the myths surrounding the
moundbuilders...Today,&nbsp; it is important to the Native Americans, to
preserve their lost ancient ansestors and their ancient customs. Most of
the remaining tribes in North America, have lost the stories of the great
moundbuilders, except for the Cherokee or Chactow tribes. In order to keep
the moundbuilder stories alive, the elders retell legends to the next generation
to hand down. The Native Americans believe the white man destroys their
sacred burial grounds. For years, the white man has taken artifacts and
destroyed their land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Native Americans believe
they have the ability to understand these ancient cultures without excavating
these sites. However, archaeologists believe salvage archaeology is important
to fill in the gaps(myths) so that we can better undestand the prehistory
of North America and the world.</font>

<p><font size=+1>Question One: A)The primary function of the codex, was
used to describe the Mixtec history and their culture. It was important
to the Mixtec culture, to document their history.&nbsp; The codex used
many different symbols to describe their history. The format used in reading
the codex: the codex was read from right to left. B) I believe the manuscript
was interpreted by reading the different symbols from right to left...The
Mixtecs used many different symbols to describe their history, such as:
animals, spectors, water, family trees, different skin colors on the people,
etc... C) The primary theme of the section our group chose was: the leader
section, depicting the black colored God acsedning to the top of the ladder,
two bigger Gods were sitting on each side of the ladder, at the top; the
figure could have been a God or a warrior who wore feathers in the headdress,
the dots below the ladder represented the number one. This section could
have been used to depict the status theme or the kings rise to the higher
status. The ladder could represent the warriors journey to the heavens.
D)Our group selected the following six items of material culture, the items
were related by: red and white stripped warrior which represents his scrafice
to the Gods, and it represented the ax that took on life after the az was
used in the scrafice. The serpent being held up under the blue water could
represent death or it was a source of food. The black figure holding the
serpent could be paying homage to the Gods, giving thanks for the food
source. The family tree represents the status within the kings family.
It was important to the Mixtecs to give names to the newborns according
to the zodiac.</font></blockquote>

<font size=+1>Question One: D)Continued: Animals were used
in the "codex" represented how the Mixtecs used the animals, such as: different
animals were to depict names in the zodiac, they were also used to as a
coat of arms (like a crest of the family) earth, wind, heaven, and water
were depicted by using animal symbols. Eagle dust was sprinkled in the
person who was to be scarficed. Earplugs were worn to show the status with
in the Mixtec culture. Jade was worn by the kings and bone might have been
worn by the warriors. Clefts and stars represented the heavens, the codex
showed Gods sitting above the ladder our group chose. Maybe this represented
the kings journey to heaven. The larger warrior who was black carried sticks(similar
to rain sticks) that were carried into battle. They let the other warrior
group know they were coming into battle. In the theme, the Mixtecs used
a larger black king or God carring a blue canoe over his head. This could
be used to depict the mode of transportation they used or how after death
the "kings" would travel to the heavens. Simimlar to how the ancient Egyptians
traveled to their afterlife. The symbols used in the codex around the large
figure could represent the gold, jade, food, religious artifacts that would
be used in the afterlife.</font>

<p><font size=+1>I forgot to mention in my journal that I did like the
video about the Divine Mission in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tucson Az. Both od
these missions represent an important period in history. However, I</font>
<br><font size=+1>am torn about what I would choose to restore and if I
would restore the missions if it would mean guady colors or making the
orginial historic work worse. I have been&nbsp; working on the archaeology
dig at the San Juan Bautista Mission, and I toured many of these missions.
Even though they are not beautiful elaborate buildings, I would restore
them to their original state. Except I would want to leave some of the
art murals, statues, ect.. in their orginial condition. If the restoration
could be done in a way as not damage or make the colors too modern, then
I would restore the building. I do feel that some historic buildings and
artifacts need to be left in their present state. I have seen the Sisten
Chapel in pictures, the restoration of the murals have been using modern
colors and techniques. This has taken some of the beauty that has been
brought about&nbsp; by the aging process. The restoration work at the San
Juan Bautista Mission is important to the community and to the public.
However, again politics decides what and how the restoration will be done.
Without the mission, tourism would not boost the</font>
<br><font size=+1>economy in San Juan. But at the same time, the tourists
wear and tear takes a toll on&nbsp; the building. I would say this is a
"catch twenty two" situation. This dilemma is exactly what I will be facing
in the type of work I will be doing. I want to work as Historical Preservationist
(director) or archival research of old historic buildings. It is important
to restore this mission because if the building was left to decay, then
people would say "Oh, I remember the way the old mission used to be." Also,
I would not just restore beautiful buildings, the old dilapidated buildings
hold historical value, too.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Divine Mission video was very similar to the old San Juan Bautista
Mission in that they were in need of restoration and they both hold historical
significance. The old mission in Tucson Az. seemed to be larger and it
contains more art murals and statuary figures. The restoration that is
being done by the art conservators, seems to be polictically influenced.
I find it very disturbing that the Catholic church doesn't take more of
role in the restoration of this mission or other missions!! Since I am
a History major and perserving historic buildings is important to me, I
think it is important that church and state should be involved in saving
these missions for future generations. The mission in Tucson is being retored
by Sunny Morales construction crew. The material they are using to restore
the building is lime plaster that was used in the eariler building of the
mission. I found the art murals in the mission to be very beautiful. The
Baroque Heaven architecture was very interesting because it depicted the
heiarchy of the Monastary genealogy. This wall seemed to consist of spiritual
imagery of God of Father and the Virgin Mary. I found the graffit and writing
in the choir loft to be very disturbing and disgrating to the Catholic
church. As to the question whether or not this mission should be restored,
I think it should be because of the seperation between church and state;
the church doesn't have enough money to restore it, so the mission would
detoriate. Sadly, this important piece of history would be lost...</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Lab Deliverable 5</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>1.The tools and procedures David Hurst Thomas and his
crew used to search for the "Lost Spanish Mission" are as follows. Thomas's
crew began with random sampling, measuring series of the area by walking
a number of steps and 100 meters wide to locate areas that they would excavate.
This method did take his crew to areas hard to reach and ofetn leading
to nothing. Thomas and his crew then evaluated all of Catherines Island,
by studing unrecorded areas,searching for lost missions such as: Santa
Catalina de Gulae. Investigating each site in mter square test units, the
crew ended up excavating more than 400 test pits. With the search looking
a little dim, Thomas and his crew began to look towards other methods.
Another method that Thomas and his crew tried was,a method they learned
form Kathleen Deagan, using a gasoline-powered posthold digger, digging
hundreds of round holes. with the results, a series of simple dog-density
maps were plotted. This allowed the crew to focus furthur on a single 100
by 100 meter square in th eiverall sampling grid for the St. Catherines
Island. The third method used, was nondestructive remote sensing. The disadvantage
Thomas and his crew encountered in th ewhole project was, not knowing where
to start.&nbsp; The advantages they had on their side were past excavations
that could assist them in trying to figure out where to start, and how
to start. Such as: using the help they recieved from Deagan. However, I
believe the dig was excueted succesfully under the circumstances. The excavation
illustrates the "maturation" in amercian Archaeology" which shows that
with scientific techniques, an excavation has some type of result and the
methods grow more advanced. Such as remote sensing, it allows data to be
found before anyone had to dive in and start digging. Remote sensing will
help with the advancement of field work archaeology. Finally, the methods
used in the quest for the "mission" were successful because they Americanist
archaeology mature in technology methods. Instead of using the tedious
method of using trowels and shovels, todays technology enables archaeologists
to use noninvasive and nondestructive methods to record archaeology. Overall,
the methods used were scientific and effective in the search. 2. During
an archaeological search, many archaeologists are</font>
<br><font size=+1>digging in blind, not really knowing what they will find
and if fing anything to support their</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;research. As a result, archaeologists have modified
their old ways of blasting away at their sites often leaving a mess, modern
ways of conducting test pit research, which quotes Davis Hurst thomas,
"tend to be quick and dirty." This method allows archaeologists to dig
"metrically" typically 1 saquare meter. Test pits must maintain three-
dimensional control of the findings of the the X axis and the Y axis (side
to side)and the Y axis. This allows archaeologists to dig square holes.This
method has draw backs as well, metrical test pits are minimum in size,
with squares much smaller squeezing out the archaeologist. However, this
method is better than leaving a big hole and digging "blind" not knowing
what statigraphy lies below. Today,archaeologists dig less in order to
save more our archaeological remains for the future. The development of
noninvasive technology does nondestructive archaeology. with modern CAT
scans and ultrasound, archaeologists can map subsurface features, without
excavating them. Which minimizes damage to the rest of the site. This wil
help to leave a legacy for future archaeologists, who will higher methods
of technology. In relation to the field work at the San Juan Bautista Mission,
the methods Professor Mendoza are different&nbsp; in some ways some ways
compared to Thomas's approach. Professor Mendoza in that the excavation
is based upon student projects and project-based learning experiences under
the development of resources for the historic preservation and archaeological
salvage fo the San Juan Bautista Mission. The mission is also being excavated
in order to start a Museum education program to be operated by students
of the Archaeology Institute and the mission amd community fo San Juan
Bautista.&nbsp; Professor Mendoza used other approaches to excavating the
mission, as opposed to Thomas's excavation methods. Thomas used Randomized
Transect approach and the Power Auger approach. 3.Ethnoarchaeology and
Experimental Archaeology contribute to Middle Range Research knowledge
and its findings by linking our ideas about world to the world itself and
gives meaning to our empirical observations. this type of&nbsp; research
dictates the way in which we percieve the past. By defining middle-range
realtionships we can define teh percise realtionships between concepts.
Such a linkage has been imporatnt to both past and comtemporary americanist
archaeology. To bride this agruments, archaeologists need to study ongoing
societies.&nbsp; Ethnoarchaeologists study living societies, observing
artifacts, features, and residues while they exist in their systemic contexts.
Today, ethnoararchaeological studies have examined,the mechanisms of artifact
curation and reuse, and the social correaltes of stone tool maufacture
and use. Ethnoarchaeologists also contribute by examining the realtionship
fo material culture to modern industrial society. Secondly, Archaeological
formation processes are being defined by experimental archaeologists. As
opposed to ethoarchaeologists work within a functioning behavior sytem,
the experimental archaeologist attempts to derive relevant processes by
means of experiemental relication; both share a primary interest in middle-range
research. Fianlly, much of this experimental research has concentrated
on the manufacture and use of stone tools, although archaeologists are
currently experimenting on different problems.</font>

The tools we used to do the Flintnapping were: different sizes of deer
antlers, stone abrader, leather hand, antler tine pressure flaker. The
technique to do pressure flaking was, hard-hammer percussion at less than
a 90 degree angle. The flake I started to shape into a cutting tool, had
