<b>MD3: Journal Review</b>
<p>Author: Cynthia Tiberend.- Subject: Urban Material Culture
<p>Date: 12/1/99.- Time: 2:53:18 PM.- Entry Num: 158
<br>The class topic for today's journal was about Urban Material Culture,
which is the
<br>study of Social - standing, political, religious, and ideology of urban
cultures. Dr. Mendoza
<br>went into Chicano/Latina sub-cultures in Arizona, to study how these
groups used graffiti,
<br>low- riders, and murals to depict their cultures. Dr. Mendoza documented
(as an anthropologist)
<br>why the sub-cultures used different symbols to represent their culture
and beliefs. For example,
<br>Chicano/Latina communities in the Southwest and in California started
to make cars into the low-
<br>riders in the early fifties, to represent the different car clubs or
sub-cultures. To be a member of
<br>the car clubs, the person had to be drug-free, clean car, in good standing
within the community,
<br>show up to all the meetings. Main stream America used to believe that
all low-riders were gang
<br>and on drugs. The Chicano sub-groups would use unique techniques on
their low-riders to separate
<br>their car club from other clubs. The forms of expression they used
were murals depicting different
<br>types of religious scenes, or symbols of women. The different members
who belong to the car club
<br>name-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plates of the low-riders have various
names and colors. Dr. Mendoza studied the murals
<br>painted by the Chicana/Latina sub-culture and documented the low-riders
because he thought this
<br>type of urban material culture would be lost. Dr. Mendoza went into
the Latina communities as an
<br>anthropologist to study and document what life was like within these
sub-cultures. Murals have been
<br>used to depict about the way of life since the beginning of time. The
murals are used within the sub-
<br>cultures for the purpose of reading (a visual image) for someone who
couldn't read. Murals signified
<br>what the community a particular community valued. Rival groups may
vandalize many of the murals.
<br>They would use spray paint to vandalize the murals. The young kids
left alone all day resort to these
<br>sub-cultures where they look for protection, drugs, and social identification.

<br>&nbsp;November 12,1999 Today was my last day for service learning at
the mission. I learned a
<br>&nbsp;lot working at the excavation site. I will miss working at the
mission. Even though the work
<br>&nbsp;is just a little dirty!! I worked in the N10W38 SE1/4 section.
The objective was 40cm. I
<br>&nbsp;was able to start the third level. As I get closer to 40cm. the
area will have more
<br>&nbsp;interesting artifacts because the area will be undisturbed. Dr.
Mendoza believes this
<br>&nbsp;specific site contains the other wall to the Nunnery building.
The artifacts found were:
<br>&nbsp;Adobe building material, white stucco, old rusty wire, rusty
nails, siltstone, and small
<br>&nbsp;Pieces of glass. I needed to make the walls in the guadrint straight
in order to prevent the
<br>&nbsp;Bathtub problem. The walls need to be shaved off with an ax,
to make them straight. This
<br>&nbsp;helps to show the stratigraphy better. The dirt seems to be easier
to remove which helps
<br>&nbsp;the excavation move along faster.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October 1,1999 Today, I went out to San Juan
Bautista Mission for my fourth field work
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project. The weather was great as usual!!
I worked in the N10W38SE1/4 quarter. John
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I worked together to bring the level down
to 40cm. Presently, we are at level two. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found this quarter to be easier to dig. The
dirt wasn't as hard and didn't contain as much
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adobe. This site was exciting to work in because
I found a lot of interesting artifacts. I had
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the pick ax more carefully than before.
Because we found large bone and a rusty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wire that was embedded in tile material. I
was curious to find out where this wire was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leading to. Finally, I uncovered the rest
of the remaining wire, it wasn't attached any other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifacts. The artifacts I found were: metal
tool, rusty wire, charcoal, stucco, and black
<br>transferware (ceramic) siltsone, and tile fragments. The most exciting
artifact I found that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day was the ceramic transferware because the
detail was beautiful. The pattern consisted
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of small white-brown flowers. Also, I learned
more about how to catalog artifacts insitu
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within the site. John also found some good
artifacts, such as white opalized glass
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fragments.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or I could shape the flake into a scrapping
tool. I was hoping to brake off a larger flake so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could make a projectile point for
an arrowhead. Next week, we hope to have some
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different hammerstones. The tools we used
to do the Flintnapping were: different sizes of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deer antlers, stone abrader, leather hand,
antler tine pressure flaker. The technique to do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pressure flaking was, hard-hammer percussion
at less than a 90-degree angle. The flake I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; started to shape into a cutting tool, had
to be thinned out and I had to prepare the cutting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edge so that it would be sharp.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flintnapping Experience: Thursday, September30,
1999. Today was our first Flintnapping
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experience in the lab. Professor Mendoza demonstrated
how the process. He was able to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attend the Gem Show in Monterey, during the
show, he was able to purchase small and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large nodules of obsidian stone. We started
working on the small nodules of obsidian. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; picked out a piece that was a little too small
because I had some difficulty hitting at a 90
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; degree angle. However, I was able to brake
off some smaller flakes that I was able to start
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to shape into a cutting tool (knife).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Juan Bautista Mission: fieldwork today,
was an interesting day! Professor
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mendoza wanted us to reach 20cm. in our quarters.
I continued to work in the N10 W38
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NW1/4 quarter. At the present time, I am still
in level one. The work was hard and tiring
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because most of the people in our class didn't
show up to help. My quarter happened to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contain hard glass material; tile material,
siltstone, and adobe. The dirt has dried up which
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; makes the digging difficult. I learned how
to use different types of picks. Next week,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Mendoza will wet down the soil,
so that the digging will be easier. Today, I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catalogued the following artifacts: light-green
glass fragments, bone fragments, stucco, and tile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fragments, siltsone, and charcoal. I learned
more about how to weigh artifacts. I hope to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bring my daughter's eighth grade class, to
tour the mission with Professor Mendoza.:)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.The tools and procedures David Hurst Thomas
and his crew used to search for the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lost Spanish Mission" is as follows. Thomas's crew
began with random sampling,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measuring series of the area by walking a
number of steps and 100 meters wide to locate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas that they would excavate. This method
did take his crew to areas hard to reach and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often leading to nothing. Thomas and his crew
then evaluated Catherine's entire Island, by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; studying unrecorded areas, searching for lost
missions such as: Santa Catalina de Gulae.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigating each site in meter square test
units, the crew ended up excavating more than
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400 test pits. With the search looking a little
dim, Thomas and his crew began to look
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; towards other methods. Another method that
Thomas and his crew tried was, a method
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they learned form Kathleen Deagan, using a
gasoline-powered posthole digger, digging
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hundreds of round holes. With the results,
a series of simple dog-density maps were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plotted. This allowed the crew to focus further
on a single 100 by 100 meter square in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overall sampling grid for the St. Catherine's Island.
The third method used, was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nondestructive remote sensing. The disadvantage
Thomas and his crew encountered in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole project was, not knowing where to start.
The advantages they had on their side
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were past excavations that could assist them
in trying to figure out where to start, and how
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to start. Such as: using the help they received
from Deagan. However, I believe the dig
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was executed successfully under the circumstances.
The excavation illustrates the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "maturation" in American Archaeology" which
shows that with scientific techniques, an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excavation has some type of result and the
methods grow more advanced. Such as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remote sensing, it allows data to be found
before anyone had to dive in and start digging.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remote sensing will help with the advancement
of fieldwork archaeology. Finally, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; methods used in the quest for the "mission" was
successful because they were using American
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archaeology technology methods. Instead of
using the tedious method of using
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trowels and shovels, today's technology enables
archaeologists to use noninvasive and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nondestructive methods to record archaeology.
Overall, the methods used were scientific
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and effective in the search. 2. During an
archaeological search, many archaeologists are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digging blind, not really knowing what they
will find and if they will find anything to support their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research. As a result, archaeologists have
modified their old ways of blasting away at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their sites often leaving a mess, modern ways
of conducting test pit research, which
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quotes Davis Hurst Thomas, "tend to be quick
and dirty." This method allows
<br>archaeologists to dig "metrically" typically 1 square meter. Test pits
must maintain three-
<br>dimensional control of the findings of the X axis and the Y axis (side
to side)and the Y
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; axis. This allows archaeologists to dig square
holes. This method has drawbacks,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metrical test pits are minimum in size, with
squares much smaller squeezing out the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archaeologist. However, this method is better
than leaving a big hole and digging "blind"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not knowing what statigraphy lies below. Today,
archaeologists dig less in order to save
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more our archaeological remains for the future.
The development of noninvasive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology does nondestructive archaeology.
with modern CAT scans and ultrasound,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archaeologists can map subsurface features,
without excavating them. Which minimizes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; damage to the rest of the site. This will
help to leave a legacy for future archaeologists,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who will higher methods of technology? In
relation to the field work at the San Juan
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bautista Mission, the methods Professor Mendoza
are different in some ways some ways
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compared to Thomas's approach. Professor Mendoza
in that the excavation is based
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon student projects and project-based learning
experiences under the development of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resources for the historic preservation and
archaeological salvage of the San Juan
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bautista Mission. The mission is also being
excavated in order to start a Museum
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; education program to be operated by students
of the Archaeology Institute and the
<br>mission and community of San Juan Bautista. Professor Mendoza used
other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approaches to excavating the mission, as opposed
to Thomas's excavation methods.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas used Randomized Transect approach and
the Power Auger approach.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Ethnoarchaeology and Experimental Archaeology
contribute to Middle Range Research
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledge and its findings by linking our
ideas about the world to the world itself and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gives meaning to our empirical observations.
this type of research dictates the way in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which we perceive the past. By defining middle-range
relationships we can define the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precise relationships between concepts. Such
a linkage has been important to both pasts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and contemporary Americanism archaeology.
To bride this arguments, archaeologists
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to study ongoing societies. Ethnoarchaeologists
study living societies, observing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifacts, features, and residues while they
exist in their systemic contexts. Today,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ethnoararchaeological studies have examined, the
mechanisms of artifact curation and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reuse, and the social correlates of stone
tool manufacture and use. Ethnoarchaeologists
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also contribute by examining the relationship
of material culture to modern industrial
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; society. Secondly, Archaeological formation
processes are being defined by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experimental archaeologists. As opposed to
ethoarchaeologists work within a functioning
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior system, the experimental archaeologist
attempts to derive relevant processes by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means of experimental relocation and both
share a primary interest in middle-range
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research. Finally, much of this experimental
research has concentrated on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manufacture and use of stone tools, although
archaeologists are currently experimenting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on different problems.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruce Bradley's video, "Flintknapping," shows
the process of how to make obsidian into a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variety of stone tools. The process was tedious
and has to be done in a precise manner,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the obsidian will fracture. Understanding
how plate stone tools have been used for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centuries, will help archaeologists better
understand "human technologies." Bradley
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shows how a large piece of flake material
can be used for large tools used for hunting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bison. The stone tool can be flaked down to
a 90' degree angle to make a serrated edge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone tool that can be used for cutting pieces
of meat. A flake blade tool can be used to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scrape down deer, antelope, and bison hides into
suede like material. Obsidian can also
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be used for making spear points. This process
is critical and tedious. Scrappers, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stones, different shapes of antlers are used
to shape the material into the point shape.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smaller flakes that brake away during the
shaping process, can be used to make other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone tools. Different shaped antlers are
used to make the obsidian thinner and flatter,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which shapes the point. Finally, a spatula
tool is used to make the notches in each side of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the spear point.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, September 17,1999, I went to work at
San Juan Bautista which is part of my
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; course work. After my first visit a week ago,
I have become more comfortable and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledgeable about what I am doing. Thus
far, the excavation at the site, has been very
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting. Yet, the excavating itself has
been slow and tedious. I find myself wanting to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dig faster. so that I can find good artifacts.
Last Friday, I excavated in the same quarter
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (N10 W38 NW1/4,Level 1) where I continued
to dig to reach 20cm. While I was excavating,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found small ceramic fragments and some different
colored glass fragments, which I was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very exciting. Professor Mendoza taught me
how to square off the sides of the N10 W38
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NW1/4 quarter. I learned how to use more archaeological
tools. The tools I used to square
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sides with were pick axes, small picks,
measuring rope, and a level. When I found the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifacts, I learned how to document where
the ceramic (artifact) is located in the site.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I had to write and document how much
the artifact weighed, length, width, etc...Then I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recorded the information onto the catalog
card. The artifact went into the bag with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catalog card. Finally, I obtained a better
technique and knowledge of how to wet/dry shift
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the excavation dirt. Besides the ceramic,
colored glass, I found more building material,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bone and wood. While I was excavating, Dr.
Mendoza's tour group came through. So we
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had to look like we knew what we were doing, oh
well...I would like to take his tour
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sometime to learn more about San Juan Bautista,
even though I have toured the site many
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the slides presented in class, the Chichen
Itza of the Yucatan region seemed to be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very intelligent and a head of their time,
for their culture. This site was very interesting and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exciting to learn about!!! If it were not
for their vivid illustrations and graphics, speculations
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that were made during this period would (1400-1840)
have remained speculative and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would have never involved into the Descriptive,
Historical, and Explanatory periods.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorers like Augustus Le Plongeon were able
to research this site which later led to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specific details of this particular culture.
As the studies progressed, this led to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; progression of knowledge and respect given
to this culture. Also, this study led to a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greater understanding of the culture. This
site had many interesting serpents that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; represented symbols to the Gods. The first
explores who were sent to uncover this site,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must have been astonished to fine the colors
intact and how massive these stone figures
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were. Today, 1940-present, archaeologists
areas still excavating these ancient ruins to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understand further these cultures. During
the Historical period, scholars from Harvard
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; researched this site to find the temples of
the kings. These explorers didn't look around
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ancient ruins; they were only concerned
with the massive ruins themselves. During the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speculative period, Augustus Le Plongeon explored
the region to speculate how and why
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these ruins were built there; they didn't
associate the ruins having been built the Mayans.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I found the ball courts to be fascinating.
One can only imagine what the games were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like. It was interesting to learn that solid
rubber balls were used to decapitate the warrior's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heads and then engraved upon the skull racks.
I would love to visit the Mayan and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chichen Itza ruins to learn more about their
culture and history. Also, I am wondering why
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we haven't learned about the queens during
these periods. Look at the book, "Forest of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Kings" co-authored by Linda Schele to
learn more about the queens. I would like to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learn more about the queens. Another book
by Schele, called "Blood of the Kings"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; describes how the Mayans did engage in warfare
and the symbolization of the blood shed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within the culture.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, was my first day at the San Juan Bautista
site. Professor Mendoza gave the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orientation. I excavated in the N10 W38 NW1/4
Quarter, level 1 area. My observations of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the site was very interesting. Presently,
the area that is being excavated, is where a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; former building stood, before raiding Indians
burned it down. I learned how to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excavate with different types of tools. Excavating
the site is tedious and dirty work, but
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaning the process was worth the effort.
Proper excavating techniques were introduced
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to us, and we how to search for artifacts
through either wet or dry methods. First, I dug up
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough dirt and material in the quarter, and
then I shifted the dirt with the wet (water)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method to look for artifacts. I found the
following artifacts: reddish-brown building
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials, stone tool chert flakes, bottle
caps, larger stone tools that were used to grind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; food, pottery shards. Another student I had
been working with, found some old Indian
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beads. I am looking forward to learning more
about the History associated with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archaeology. I have an interest in History.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stone Tool I have is 4.16 and the color
on the Munsell Color chart is 10R 4/2(Grayish
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red). I think the stone tool I have a tool
that was used to grind and mash different types of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; food. The size of the tool is about 2.5" in
length, and 1" in width. The tool has ridges
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running across the top. I don't think my tool
has cortex on both sides of the tool. Also, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone tool has the classification of Secondary
and flake type is: complete, early-stage
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; biface thinning. Looking through the tool
when holding it up to the light, it looks clear,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost chalky white. The tool has ridges that
indicate that the flute has been broken away
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the core stone. The stone tool has more
ridges on the exterior side and less on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interior side. The stone is called Chaclodona.
The tool was also used for scraping things
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with. The tool has a rounded edge running
across the top. On the exterior side, the color is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; muddy greenish color indicating glue was used
on the tool to paste it to wood.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flintknapping: #4.10:The description of the artifact:
the color is dark reddish-brown at the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of it, black-yellow towards the middle, on
the bottom, the color changes very dark
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reddish-brown. shape: looks like an arrow
head or some sort of projectile tool, or spear
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head. size: the length is about 1'1/2. texture:
more rough and waxy than the other artifacts,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the material could be chalcedony material.
The artifact may have been used to make a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spear for hunting and fishing or for war.
Possibly it could have been used as tool to make
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pottery. This artifact could have been found
New Mexico or Utah regions. artifact2.05:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color: tan, with some reddish-pink and grey mixed
through the artifact. texture: the artifact feels
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very smooth, like it could have whitewashed
from the sea. The sand and salt water could
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have polished the tool smooth. The material looks
like slate. shape: the artifact looks like
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an arrowhead or sharks tooth. This artifact
could have been used to make some sort of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jewelry, maybe a necklace or in some sort
of headdress. The artifact could have been
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used to hunt animals or to catch fish. However,
knowing what shark's teeth look like, I don't
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know for sure. The green algae, could have
washed and eroded into the material as it was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being formed.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions: 1) The primary "myths" of archaeology
and the moundbuilders noted in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; video was: Early explorers and surveyors believed
that the "mounds" could not have been
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; built by early Indian tribes because they
were too unskilled. They thought the mounds were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; built by an advanced civilization with better
skills. The early explores made started these
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myths based upon assumptions. The explorers
thought the Vikings and the Welch people
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they explored this area. In the late
1700's, white settlers found the first mounds in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohio Valley. The settlers thought the mounds
were built by the same ancient tribes. They
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also thought tribes passing through on their
way to Mexico built the mounds. In
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1860's, French explorers found that the mound
builders buried their dead in the center of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mounds. I believe the early explorers
did not look into possible other facts. They based
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their myths upon assumptions without verifying
the data. Also, these myths were based
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon the research materials and beliefs that
were prevalent during this time period. They
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't have the advanced equipment archaeologists
have today. Finally, I do agree with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the myth that the mounds were built two different
ancient Indian cultures. 2) The "mound
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reconstruction" experiment undertaken by the
archaeologists was important because
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern man has torn down most of the mounds.
Before these mound are gone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely, archaeologists want to document
the two cultures who built the mounds. So that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we can better understand how and why these
ancient people built these mounds.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened when they migrated here after
the "ice age" and why they chose to build?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these mounds. The archaeologists wanted to
understand how the techniques and how
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long it took to build them. The experiment
helped to understand the two different cultures
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that built these mounds (Hopewell and Miss.
Culture, around Christ's time). The two
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cultures built their mounds similar. During
the experiment, archaeologists rebuilt the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mound in the same way they believe the Hopewell
did. This would explain what it was like
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to build the mounds. How, why, where they
were built. Finally, the researchers hoped to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leave the mound for at least five years, so
that they could excavate latter to record what
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they found. 3) The value and approach represented
by the "salvage archaeology" was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done by early archaeologists who wanted to
salvage the remaining mounds and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifacts that remained. Many of the artifacts
in the mounds were already taken by white
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settlers to sell them at high prices for profit.
Salvage Archaeology is done by archaeologist
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to put the mound builders myths to rest. Today,
researchers are studying the remaining
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounds in Ohio valley. Campsville Center was
created to research the moundbuilders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salvage archaeologists study the existing
condition of the mounds. They look at the layers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the dirt and how it was poured. Also, the
remaining artifacts within the mound describe
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their culture and how they used them. Since
the Hopewell and Miss. cultures existed over
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000 years ago, excavating sites this way
will help to preserve and document their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; existence. This will help to understand the
highly skilled intelligence these cultures
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessed. How they could have constructed
these great mounds with primitive tools.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How they were able to organize their community
to build the mounds. Also, this research
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will help archaeologists understand the status
of the families and people within these
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cultures. How and why their agriculture changed
due to corn and better nutrition. Finally,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "salvage archaeology" will dismantle the myths
surrounding the moundbuilders...Today, it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is important to the Native Americans, to preserve
their lost ancient ancestors and their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ancient customs. Most of the remaining tribes
in North America, have lost the stories of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great moundbuilders, except for the Cherokee
or Choctaw tribes. In order to keep the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moundbuilder stories alive, the elders retell
legends to the next generation to hand down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Native Americans believe the white man
destroys their sacred burial grounds. For
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, the white man has taken artifacts and
destroyed their land. Native Americans
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; believe they have the ability to understand
these ancient cultures without excavating these
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites. However, archaeologists believe salvage
archaeology is important to fill in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaps (myths) so that we can better understand
the prehistory of North America and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could have been a God or a warrior who wore
feathers in the headdress, the dots below
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ladder represented the number one. This
section could have been used to depict the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; status theme or the kings rise to the higher
status. The ladder could represent the warriors
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journey to the heavens. D) Our group selected
the following six items of material culture,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the items were related by: red and white-stripped
warrior, which represents his sacrifice to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Gods and it represented the az that took
on life after the az was used in the sacrifice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The serpent being held up under the blue water
could represent death or it was a source
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of food. The black figure holding the serpent
could be paying homage to the Gods, giving

represents the status within the king's family. It
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was important to the Mixtecs to give names
to the newborns according to the zodiac.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings flaking stone tools, trade beads,
and Bavine tooth found at the excavation site,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might help explain how and why the tribe lived
there. Also, who the people where and what
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their culture was like. The Bavine tooth may
have come from some type of animal the tribe
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunted for food. The Spanish colonial trade
bead, may have been used to trade between
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tribes for goods and different types of
food. The Chert core could have been the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material used to make their own tools. I would
make a guess that the Indian tribe could
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been influenced by the Spanish culture.
The Indians and the Spanish people whom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migrated from Mexico, could have traded with
each other. The excavated site could have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been a sacred site. Maybe the site could have
been the tribes main housing area or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they conducted human and animal sacrifice.
Sending their spirits to the

behind by a animal passing through the area or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that once lived there.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't been up to the excavation site,

Mendoza suggested that I continue working
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the N10W38SE1/4. The objective is still
40cm. I worked with John in the unit, we were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; able to reach the third level. Before we started
to excavate further, we had to dismantle the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first and second levels that we had been digging
around because they had been
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disturbed. At one point, we were exciting
because we thought we had found a human skull
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a canon ball!! However, our hopes we crushed
because Professor Mendoza
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determined that the artifact was a polished
rock with pressure cracks running through it. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used the dry sifting method instead of the
wet method. The artifacts I found were red
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; building material, white earthenware ceramic
fragments, stucco, and adobe building
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material. Unfortunately, I didn't find anything
exciting. Although, Professor Mendoza

wall, we have been excavating for.

percussion and pressure flaking methods;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the class objective was to start shaping a
piece of obsidian into some sort of stone tool. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used hard-hammer percussion to start flaking
the stone into a scraping tool. In order to get
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the desired shape, I used a small pebble and
small deer antler tools in the process. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most difficult problem I encountered was trying
to thin the stone tool into an oval shape. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had to hold the tool at an 45degree angle,
in to produce flakes off the tool which would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make the tool shaper. The most important thing
to remember in the "Flintknapping"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process, using the right protective gear and
holding the stone correctly...One of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students in the lab, put a piece of sharp
obsidian through his glove because he wasn't
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holding the material correctly. I found the
"Flintknapping" process to be exciting,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; especially when you have broken off a good
chunk of stone that can be shaped into a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stonetool.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning an archaeological excavation takes
considerable thought and planning. Today's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual dig showed how to prepare and set
up the budget proposal. The value of this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exercise showed how to plan and stay within
the budget. The budget should contain how
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much food, site crew, equipment, accommodations,
airfare, etc...sometimes the proposed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amount should be changed before submitting
the budget. When we first submitted the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; budget, it was denied, then we reviewed where
we could add more money or take away
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money from certain categories. The budget
total went from $89,000 up to $104,000.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the first budget rejection, the review
board suggested that we needed to change
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some areas. The most important areas in planning
an archaeological dig would be crew
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; members, equipment, airfare, vehicles, and
principal crew members, and living
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrangements.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major myth of the Mound Builders was that
they were from North America. They were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thought to be nomads, Vikings who were lost
people passing through North America on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're way to Central Mexico. Europeans refused
to believe these massive mounds could
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be built by Native American cultures. They
thought they were too savage and unskilled to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build the mounds. During the early excavations,
the researchers found evidence from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skulls, that confirmed that two ancient Native
American cultures did create these massive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounds. Thomas who was sent by the government,
to finally resolve these myths,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discovered two cultures. These "Mound Builders"
were called the Hopewell people and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Mississippian people. Today, Salvage excavation
is used by archaeologist to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research the ancient artifacts and to better
understand these two cultures better. However,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the other hand, Salvage excavation invades
the ancient burial grounds. This may be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why Native Americans believe white people
discrete and loot their ancient burial sites.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Native Americans believe they have skills
to research these ancient "Mound Builders" in a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way that does not disturb these sites. However,
archaeologists believe it is important to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excavate these sites in St. Louis to better
understand the world around us. Why and where
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did man migrate from? To understand the "hunter/gather"
and their way of life. Also, to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preserve these "mounds" before modern civilization
demolishes them forever. Without
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this type of research, these answers will
be lost...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to mention in my journal that I did
like the video about the Divine Mission in Tucson
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Az. Both of these missions represent an important
period in history. However, I am torn
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about what I would choose to restore and if
I would restore the missions if it would mean
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gaudy colors or making the original historic
work worse. I have been working on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archaeology dig at the San Juan Bautista Mission,
and I toured many of these missions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though they are not beautiful elaborate
buildings, I would restore them to their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original state. Except I would want to leave
some of the art murals, statues, ect.. in their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original condition. If the restoration could
be done in a way as not damage or make the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colors too modern, then I would restore the
building. I do feel that some historic buildings
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and artifacts need to be left in their present
state. I have seen the Sisten Chapel in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures, the restoration of the murals have
been using modern colors and techniques.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has taken some of the beauty that has
been brought about by the aging process. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restoration work at the San Juan Bautista
Mission is important to the community and to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the public. However, again politics decides
what and how the restoration will be done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the mission, tourism would not boost
the economy in San Juan. But at the same
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time, the tourists wear and tear takes a toll
on the building. I would say this is a "catch
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twenty two" situation. This dilemma is exactly
what I will be facing in the type of work I will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be doing. I want to work as Historical Preservationist
(director) or archival research of old
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; historic buildings. It is important to restore
this mission because if the building was left to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decay, then people would say "Oh, I remember
the way the old mission used to be." Also,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not just restore beautiful buildings,
the old dilapidated buildings hold historical
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value, too.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Divine Mission video was very similar
to the old San Juan Bautista Mission in that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were in need of restoration and they
both hold historical significance. The old mission
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Tucson Az. seemed to be larger and it contains
more art murals and statuary figures.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restoration that is being done by the
art conservators, seems to be politically
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; influenced. I find it very disturbing that
the Catholic church doesn't take more of role in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restoration of this mission or other missions!!
Since I am a History major and preserving
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; historic buildings is important to me, I think
it is important that church and state should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved in saving these missions for future
generations. The mission in Tucson is being
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restored by Sunny Morales construction crew.
The material they are using to restore the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; building is lime plaster that was used in
the earlier building of the mission. I found the art
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; murals in the mission to be very beautiful.
The Baroque Heaven architecture was very
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting because it depicted the hierarchy
of the Monastery genealogy. This wall
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seemed to consist of spiritual imagery of
God of Father and the Virgin Mary. I found the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graffiti and writing in the choir loft to
be very disturbing and desecrating to the Catholic
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; church. As to the question whether or not
this mission should be restored, I think it should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be because of the separation between church
and state; the church doesn't have enough
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money to restore it, so the mission would
detriorate. Sadly, this important piece of history
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would be lost...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mapping strategy I used: I placed and
lined my map and the grid directly across the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; top of the gray area of the map. My results
in the mapping activity were half and half. I hit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where most of the settlements and excavation
sites were located. I did hit a fairly large
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; area of the map, in strategy 1) my results
of the grid squares were good. In strategy two, I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't have a lot of luck, however, I did
hit upon one of the areas. For strategy three, I found
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many excavated areas within the map area.
I had better luck here, I hit upon four - five
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas. I hit upon grid squares: W7, V3, V4,
Q3. In strategy four, I didn't have good luck. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choose the grid squares in the hill country.
I'm not sure what would be considered noise
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas. Finally, my mapping strategy was the
best in one and three mapping exercises.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This activity showed how archaeologists might
not find what they are looking for.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My method of choosing my samples and transects
for each step were very random. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first step was to pick&nbsp; grid squares
that would represent an area on the map that I would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be interesting to look at. In doing samples,
U2, V6, U5, U7, S3, V8, G7, T5, T9, V3. These
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; samples draw out the region of the map. I
thought to be most interesting to dig up and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research. The second step was to pick five
transects that would be of interest to me to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; study. I chose transect B, because going down
the hills it looked like it would have a lot of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tribes. I chose T because it looked like an
area the people would have chose because it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is rich fertile land. I chose V because it
contained the largest of the settlement. I chose U
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the same reason as T and it was short.
The third step was to choose ten grid squares
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the basis of predicted settlement. I choose
the high area of the map because it had the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; river and rich fertile valley areas that would
be of value to the tribes to build their cities. I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choose B9, K13, W7, G8, L5, L9, V3, M8, V4,
Q3. Also, I did choose some areas on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of the map because they were at the
bottom of the river valley, there might have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been a water fall and lots of vegetation for
food sources and game to hunt. Finally, I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choose a stratified sample of five grids squares
selected to factor out noise...areas
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; included within the topographic areas, everything
else would be considered factored out
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noise. I choose K11, M10, L12, J13, L14.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we went to the lab to conduct Stone
Tools experiments. I wasn't able to attend
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday's lab. During the first lab, I picked
out a large obsidian stone which I started
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hitting at a 90 degree angle. I was able to
get a large flake that I shaped into a cutting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knife. We used small pebbles to brake off
the flakes. The trap was marked off into grids
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is similar to the San Juan Bautista's
excavation site. On Thursday, the class picked
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their grids and started to excavate the grids.
The excavation wasn't as dirty as opposed to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mission work.
