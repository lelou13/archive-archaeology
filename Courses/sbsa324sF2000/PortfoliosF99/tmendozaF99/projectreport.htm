<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p>In having participated in a total of six excavations at the San Juan
Bautista Mission, my experiences range so differently from excavation day
1 to excavation day 6. Although all six days may seem quite similar, something
new always happened or some interesting artifact somehow managed to show
up amongst my day’s findings. The following journal entries all illustrate
and clearly draw each days’ experience and findings. The journal entries
best define the learning outcomes I attribute to the excavations and the
holistic purpose of the project. The purpose of the excavation is to locate
the old foundation that once existed along with the rest of the currently
standing parts of the Mission. Although the diggings became tedious at
time and painful due to annoying blisters, the over-all purpose as a student
working at the mission was still clear. As a student at the mission participating
with the excavations, the learning outcome goals intended were to apply
classroom lectures, readings and videos to real hands-on fieldwork. The
excavations at the San Juan Bautista Mission allowed me to have this experience
and is best illustrated through my excavation journal entries.
