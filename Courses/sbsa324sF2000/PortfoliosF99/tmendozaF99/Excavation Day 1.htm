The first day in the excavation at the San Juan Bautista Mission consisted
of a brief Orientation and history of the lot and afterwards, actual hands
on experience. I was able to have a specific area, North10West38, NW 1/4,
where I was assigned to dig and collect the dirt into specific buckets.
Out of an objective of 20 levels, I dug on the first level. Next the dirt
and rocks in the bucket was emptied onto a screen where it was finely sifted
and hosed down until all you had on the screen were solid items such as
pebbles, rocks, and possible artifacts. This was where you could actually
see what was in the area where you were digging. By the end of the day
I was successful in having a few significant findings. Such as bone fragments
believed to be of an animal of some sort. I also discovered a little piece
of enamel, possibly a human tooth. Another find was lithics, quartzite
flakes. Also silt stone fragments, roof tile believed to be of the colonial
ages, glass shard, rusted metal fragments were found. The most significant
and rare find was a Spanish Colonial Glass Bead. It is incredible that
after 200 years these items remain in the same spot where they were left.
