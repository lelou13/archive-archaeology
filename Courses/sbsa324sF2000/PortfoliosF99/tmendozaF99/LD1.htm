<P>Lab Deliverable 1:  Archaeology Video Review&#9;</P>

<P>The primary myths of archeology and the moundbuilders as noted in the video commentary was that the moundbuilders could in no way had been Indians, but believed that the moundbuilders were "noble" and "white" men who stopped during their travels to build the mounds.  The Indians were believed to be too "savegely" to hold the knowledge to build the mounds.  The mounds were believed to have been built by perhaps a "lost race."  When artifacts were found in the mounds, they were quickly assumed to be European artifacts.  Perhaps these myths became to be because of the prejudices that stood against the Indians during that time.  Indians were believed to be savages while White men were honored and regarded as always being noble.</P>
</FONT><P>&#9;<FONT FACE="Times">The "mound reconstruction" experiment illustrated the great effort, team work and descipline necessary to accomplish a good enough size mound.  The experiment allowed the students and viewers to really see the efforts it takes to actually build a mound step by step, tediously and manually.  The experiment seeked to demonstrate how the Indians managed to work together, in a desciplined assembly line, and had in their own way, a different type of technology.</P>
<P>&#9;Salvage archaeology can be described as collecting artifacts, anything you can find in a primary area to further your research.  This type of archaeology is beneficial because anything that can be "salvaged", or saved, from a historic site, may assist in some way to the interpretation of North American prehistory.  I can't really think of a way salvage archaeology would be destructive, because everything comes to a place for some reason, any reason being.</P></FONT></BODY>
