<br>Chichen
<br>09/22/99
<br>From the slides presented in class, the Chichen Itza of the Yucatan
seemed to be a very illustrative and intelligent culture. If it were not
for their vivid illustrations and graphics, speculations that were made
in the 1400-1840s would have remained speculations and would have never
progressed into the Descriptive, Historical and Explanatory Periods. Researchers
like Augustus Le Plongeon were able to study the culture which later led
to much specific details of the culture from all the rich artifacts left
behind by the Chichen. The progress of the studies can also be attributed
to how much more respect was given to the study of the ancient culture
as many Americans chose to attain a college degree and study the ancient
cultures such as Chichen. Le Plongeon, who studied the Chichen culture
during the Descriptive period, was able to make many first discoveries
such as the Chac Mool, "Red Jaguar." He was able to make much more descriptive
findings and recording such findings with importance. It is also amazing
how the Chichen people carved their stones and decorated them with jewels
such as jade and mother of Pearls, such as the Red Jaguar.

<br>Flintnapping Video
<br>09/29/99
<br>In Bruce Bradley's "Flintknapping" video, he shows a step by step process
of how one piece of obsidian can be used for a variety of projects. He
begins with a fairly large piece of obsidian, showing the viewers how flaking
is done at how it can be determined what the shape of your flake material
will be by the angle at which you strike the large piece of Obsidian, which
should be an at angle of 90 degrees or less. He shows the complexity of
stone tool types by showing how a large piece of flake material can be
used for large projects, such as hunting bison, then he shows how that
stone tool can be flaked down to make it into a tool for skinning, cutting
large pieces of meat, scraping and then a spearpoint. Some of the main
flaking tools Bradley used were hammerstones, bones, and antlers. With
those tools, he could modify a stone tool for a specific job. With all
this, he shows the variety of stone tool types that exist and the importance
of stone tools.

<p>Stone Tools
<br>10/07/99
<br>On Thursday at the lab we randomly collected samples from the gritted
tarp, my samples varied from every size and weight. My first grid square
had nothing but little pieces of 1-2cm flakes that did not weight altogether
more than 2 grams. My second grid had flakes from 1-7+cm weighing from
1-12 grams. My samples included very big flakes to barely nothing flakes.
This lab activity was very similar to the work we do on Fridays at the
Old San Juan Bautista Mission, where we randomly collected samples from
a certain grid, then collected our samples together, separating them by
object, then measuring and weighing them, and finally labeling them each
with the proper numbers and data. This was a lot easier from the Mission
Digs ofcourse because it didn't require getting down and dirty and getting
blisters on your hands. But really, with this lab I was familiar with what
to do because of the couple times I've gone to the Mission and used the
same steps in collecting samples. This lab activity showed how random your
samples can be, how one area could contain so many samples, and right beside
it nothing may exist but dirt. Looking at all the samples on the grid,
you could kind of picture that possibly this is how it looks beneath an
archaeological dig site and the challenge is to find the grids with the
samples.

<p>LD: Divine Mission Video
<br>11/03/99
<br>This video of the Old Mission in Tucson is somewhat similar to the
Old Mission in San Juan Bautista in the way that they are both very old
and need much protection and both hold so much history around them. The
Mission in Tucson seemed like a real Holy place where worship is so much
connected with the beautiful Art that surrounds the whole building. I also
found it architecturally magnificent the way the whole architect of it
is shaped into a Latin Cross. Being Catholic, if I were in a place as overwhelming
as the Mission in Tucson during a mass, my religious spirituality would
just burst out. And that's just one of the purpose of why the Mission was
built with such holistic Art, to attract the Indians to the beauty of the
Church and hopefully into the religion. What a speaker said in the video
about the art in Roman Catholic Churches was true and I agreed with greatly,
that there is nothing accidental in the placement of imagery in a Roman
Catholic Church. The walls in a Catholic Church tell a story, presents
a Saint or a part in the Bible, and that's why it is so important that
the Art is restored and kept up. It was interesting how Lime and Sand base
plaster was the original type of material used on the foundation walls
of the Mission. I never knew that Lime and Sand would be strong enough
or adequate for a chapel wall. What I did find disturbing in the video
was how there were graffiti and random writings on the art on the wall;
it seemed as if random people/visitors showed disrespect to the Church
by writing on the wall like that.

<p>LD: Restoration
<br>11/03/99
<br>If I was one of the people who made the deciding factors on what should
be restored, preserved or just even touched in the Old mission San Juan
Bautista, I would not really know what to decide right-off. So many things
play into such decisions and the history of it all is just so important
but not all known. I would like to see the statues and walls the way they
were in the beginning, but it is also natural that they be kept as they
are and that time will play its part, and that's just how things are, things
get old and it's time for new ones. But when I am faced with amazing artifacts
that tell a great story of the past, I would be torn between the need to
live in the present and the need to live in the past. However, I think
I would be more in favor of keeping things as they are, and that history
is what makes history, things that come and go. And the tangible items
that come along with history are not as important when the history has
been written and acknowledged. It would just be so difficult to make such
decisions. But I think, sometimes letting go is what makes some things
more precious.

<p>Virtual Dig 1
<br>11/10/99
<br>Planning an archaeological dig does take up some thought, as we experienced
in today's class activity with the virtual dig. A lot of thought comes
into how many people you want, how much you want to pay each person, equipment,
living arrangement, travel, insurance.... and the list goes on. It seems
to me, that such a dig would require at least $100,000 to fund all the
necessities. On the class activity with the Virtual Dig program, our proposal
was accepted and graded as "very good". I think the class did evenly spread
out what was needed, who, where, how much....etc. This exercise is essentially
valuable to learning what comes into planning an archaeological dig, and
how important it is to plan because once the dig has started and somehow
the planning was not done correctly and the budget is not accommodating
everyone and the equipment that is needed, this could cause a very unsuccessful
dig. I think the two most important part of the planning, is the principal
site supervisor, and the crewmembers. IF there's a lack of funding, basically
with those two groups of people, the dig is made possible, plus it is those
two that would have the knowledge to plan a Dig. The other most important
factor in the planning, are the living conditions of the crew because if
the crew becomes fatigued, hungry, sick due to bad living conditions, the
dig can be called off, because it is difficult to find a crew that knows
what they're doing, especially if you have only a period of time to complete
the dig.

<p>Garbology 1
<br>11/17/99
<br>Today's class lecture was very interesting. I had no idea how much
garbage can tell such a story, or depict how an individual/s may live their
life, from simply investigating what types of foods they ate. The CNN report
on "Food to Die For" revealed how a family revealed what they would have
"like" to think their dietary habits were, when in actuality, the Garbology
investigation done on them revealed quite the opposite, that they did not
eat as healthy as they claimed and like to think. It's also interesting
how this method of investigation can also be used to study human behavior,
such as the Denver Garbage Project. I never really knew that so much could
be found from investigating the tracks and trash people leave. If someone
were to investigate my Garbage, I know on a good week, as in where I'm
eating healthy, they'd find tuna cans, broccoli peelings, empty milk cartons,
wheat bread plastic bags, and onion peels, etc. But on a regular day, some
items that would be found in my trash are spoiled leftovers, fast food
from the local Oriental cafe, Taco Bell, and banana peelings. I know I'd
probably say that I ate pretty healthy, or tried, but my dietary habits
are so inconsistent, and a Garbology project done on me for a period of
at least two weeks may reveal that, but a Garbology project done on me
for one week would not. One comment that was made in class was that healthy
foods, such as vegetables and fruits, left less evidence. I agree with
that comment because I usually take my banana or apple to go, I usually
put vegetable peelings down the drain, I usually put chicken skin &amp;
fat down the drain, and I eat lots of rice which I buy in 7 lb. bags, so
a rice bag would not be found in my trash until about every 2 months. As
far as my bathroom trash, you would definitely find a lot of toilet paper,
because we consume a lot of that. However, my husband consumes more beauty
projects than I do, such as facials, and facial creams, so that's something
that may be assumed was mine, but was really my husband's. All in all,
I think Garbology is really interesting, and I never knew that it told
so much about someone's life, not just his or her eating habit, but about
his or her life.
