<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4></center>
On my third day at the Mission, December 03, 1999, I worked on the same
area I worked the last times. The area was N10W38NE1/4. It was incredibly
easier this time to dig through the area because the rain had soaked through
the dirt and had allowed it to soften up a lot. This area did contain a
lot of floor tile, totaling up to about 1,000 grams of floor tile.&nbsp;
What was also strange about the site was we also found a bolt, which may
be an indicator that the site was disturbed.&nbsp; Other fragments that
was found on the site were 50.8 g of bone, 4.5 g of glass, and 0.8 g of
opalized glass. My partner and I were digging towards the end of level
2, about just 5 cm short until we would reach 40 centimeters, the objective.
I was astonished at how much floor tile was found on this specific area,
perhaps this was a location of floor/foundation, because the sight next
to it, also contained some evidence of a wall/floor. The site was extrememly
easy to dig, except the random worm colonies I would run into.
