<p>This video of the Old Mission in Tucson is somewhat similar to the Old
Mission in San Juan Bautista in the way that they are both very old and
need much protection and both hold so much history around them. The Mission
in Tucson seemed like a real Holy place where worship is so much connected
with the beautiful art that surrounds the whole building. I also found
it architecturally magnificent the way the whole architect of it is shaped
into a Latin Cross. Being Catholic, if I were in a place as overwhelming
as the Mission in Tucson during a mass, my religious spirituality would
just burst out. And that's just one of the purpose of why the Mission was
built with such holistic Art, to attract the Indians to the beauty of the
Church and hopefully into the religion. What a speaker said in the video
about the art in Roman Catholic Churches was true and I agreed with greatly,
that there is nothing accidental in the placement of imagery in a Roman
Catholic Church. The walls in a Catholic Church tell a story, presents
a Saint or a part in the Bible, and that's why it is so important that
the Art is restored and kept up. It was interesting how Lime and Sand base
plaster was the original type of material used on the foundation walls
of the Mission. I never knew that Lime and Sand would be strong&nbsp; enough
or adequate for a chapel wall. What I did find disturbing in the video
was how there were graffiti and random writings on the art on the wall,
it seemed as if random people/visitors showed disrespect to the Church
by writing on the wall like that.
