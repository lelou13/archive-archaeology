<font face="Arial"><font size=+3>Major Deliverable 1: Self Assessment</font></font>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4></center>
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My purpose for enrolling in this
class was because of my sudden interest in archaeology. I was never really
exposed to archaeology in high school, but as an SBSC major I began to
hear about different types of field research methods, and one of them being
archaeology. As a student who is highly interested in the Social Sciences,
I never realized or was never taught in high school how archaeology holds
a strong connection within the Social Sciences. Not really knowing what
I would learn in this class, I had preset ideas of what archaeologists
do, and now I realize much more about archaeology and that my preset ideas
were not so accurate at all. With all that I have learned, I feel that
I have met my objectives in enrolling in this class through the fieldwork
and the class lectures.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first thought that archaeologists
just researched and dug wherever they thought they could find decent samples.
I did not realize the planning, mapping and informative research that is
needed to have an efficient and effective dig. Most of all I did not realize
the real effort it takes to go out to the site and dig on a consistent
basis. In my participation with all the Lab and Field Deliverables, with
the exception of the first Flintknapping Lab, I have been able to grasp
a real hands-on experience and knowledge of archaeology. As a new student
to the whole study of archaeology, I did not realize how much there is
to learn. I committed myself to attending every class lecture and thus
have been able to keep up to date on all the Deliverables and all schedule
changes that have happened throughout the first part of this semester.
I have also kept accurate writings of my completion of all the Deliverables
in the Online Journal. My comments on the Online Journal best illustrate
my full participation in the class deliverable and the full circle of how
much I learn from each deliverable. When I post my comments on the Online
Journal I always make sure that I have written everything that I feel best
explains what I have experienced in that activity or assignment and whatever
new knowledge that I have adopted because of the assignment.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fieldwork that I have participated
in at the San Juan Bautista Mission has also been quite surprising and
a very new learning experience for me. When I am actually at the site,
digging, sifting, measuring, labeling and collecting samples I realize
how I have learned so quickly the basic steps in collecting samples at
a site because of having the actual on-hands experience. This is why I
have opted to do the Field Option verses the Final project report. I believe
that I have learned more by actually going to a site and digging to find
samples.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my first dig it was quite exciting
to find an Old Spanish Bead believed to be 200 years old. This gave me
the "because" and "why" archaeologist are willing to go out on a site and
dig for hours and days without any real guarantee that they will find even
a single sample. For this reason, I would choose the Field Deliverable
as the most enjoying class activity. I also enjoyed having access to the
Online Field Journal and having access to other students’ entries as a
chance to kind of get a feel on what they’ve experienced out at the site
also.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would identify my Online Journal
entries as my primary strengths because they show my participation in all
the Lab Deliverables. My Trips out to the San Juan Bautista Mission would
be my other strength because my learning experience at the site has put
all the Lab Deliverables into work and has allowed me to apply what I learn
in the classroom onto the field. For the duration of the semester, I will
continue with my fieldwork at the Mission and hope to complete this class
with a clear perspective on the study of archaeology so that I may be more
familiar with that sector of my major.</font></blockquote>
