<p><font size=+2>Lithics Lab:</font>
<p>Working at the Lithics Lab was very exciting. From watching the video
on flintnapping, you don't really get the real idea of how difficult it
is to actually flinktnap with your own two hands and to make stone tools.
AT the lab the students got a real idea of how it used to be when man had
to create and make their own tools with whatever they had. Today everything
is simply made for everyone through computers and machines, it's seldom
that we now make objects, especially tools, with our own two hands. Making
the stone tools got somewhat frustrating too, it gets difficult to try
to make something specific with a stone. I know in the lab we were simply
experimenting and learning, but I know the Indians depended on this and
was a key part to their survival. The stone tools served as their tools
for food, protection and building their homes. I didn't realize what real
skill it takes to make stone tools.
