<p>1. In the quest for the "Lost Spanish Mission" David Hurst Thomas and
his crew began by random sampling, measuring series of the area by walking
a number of steps and 100 meters wide to find areas that they would dig.
This method did take his crew to areas hard to reach, and often leading
to nothing. Thomas and his crew then evaluated the whole Catherines Island,
studying unrecorded areas, searching for lost missions such as Santa Catalina
de Guale. Investigating each site in meter square test units, the crew
ended up excavating more than 400 such test pits. With the search looking
a little dim, Thomas and his crew began to look towards other methods.
The next methods that Thomas and his crew tried was one, a method they
learned from Kathleen Deagan, using a gasoline-powered posthold digger,
digging hundreds of round holes. With the results, a series of simple dog-density
maps were plotted. This method allowed the crew to focus further on a single
100 by 100 meter square in the overall sampling grid for the St. Catherines
Island. Another method the crew used was nondestructive remote sensing.
I believe that the big disadvantage Thomas and his crew had in this whole
project was not knowing where to start. The advantages that were on their
side was past excavations that could assist them in trying to figure out
where to start and how to start, such as the help they received from Deagan.
I think the dig was employed succesfully with the circumstances. The excavation
illustrates the "maturation in American archaeology" showing that with
scientific techniques, an excavation have some kind of result and the methods
grow more and more advanced. Such as Remote sensing, it allowed data to
be found before anyone had to actually dive in and start digging.&nbsp;
In the long run, this will add to the advancement of archaeology field
work.

<p>2. During an archaeological search, many archaeologist are digging in
blind, not really knowing what they will find and if they will find anything
to support their research. As a result, archaeologists have modified their
old ways of simply blasting away at their sites often leaving a big mess,
to the modern ways of conducting "Test Pits" which quotes David Hurst Thomas,
"tend to be quick and dirty."&nbsp; With this method, archaeologist then
dig "metrically" typically 1 meter square. maintaining a three-dimensional
control with an x,y, and z axis. Sidewalls are created to keep the area
straight and perpendicular, keeping the area clean and a specific area
where findings can be accurately marked. This new way of modern Archaeological
digging is also due to the new ethical ways that digging should be less
and to save more of the archaeological remains for the future, believing
that archaeological grandchildren will have invented and possess far greater
methods, theories, and technology for the archaeological world. With professor
Mendoza's field work at the Old Mission San Juan Bautista, he also digs
in squares, then dividing the big square in four little equal squares making
his north, south, west, east areas. The only difference with Thomas and
professor Mendoza's work is perhaps the way he has marked each dig site,
where Thomas uses axis Mendoza uses N,S,W. From my own experience at the
site, it's profoundly a better way to dig at an area where you can specifically
mark where you have found dat<font size=-1>a.</font>
