   <title>Topographic mapping provides meaning</title>
</head>
<body>

<b>Notes</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Topographic mapping provides meaning. They show relief by using contour
lines and elevation measurements.
<p><b>Datum Point</b>--the fixed reference point for the entire excavation.
Chosen based on boundaries and natural features.
<p>How do you map rugged terrain? Survey, a review of something.
<p>Benchmark---topographic survey marker (permanent platform)
<p><b>Brunton Transit Compass</b>--true north, look down through one eyepiece
into a mirror up through other eyepiece to a spot on the horizon. The north,
west, east, and south need to be determined.
<p>Chinese invented the compass 1500 y.a. Olmec Indians used a magnetic
<b>compass.</b>
<p><b>Compass</b>--magnetized piece of metal mounted and turning freely
on a pivot pointing to magnetic north. Magnetic north is constantly being
adjusted.
<p><b>Unit datum</b>--fixed point on a site.
<p><b>Sextant</b>: Navigational instrument for measuring the angle between
horizon and sun in order to determine latitude.
<p><b>Transit</b>--
<p>Soil smears are important because the soil colors might change due to
trash, burning materials, creating strata.
<p>Indian Springs, CO. Wilderness area. Native Americans have been in the
area for 12,000 years. Mapped an 1800-acre parcel. Context is important,
knowing the relationship of things to other things.
<p><b>Mesoamerica</b>--one of the areas of advanced civilization where
language spread. Epiclassic--on the margins of classic. End of classic
in Mesoamerica. AD 600-900. Epi means marginal.
<p><b>Ethnohistory--</b>history of human culture
<p>Mayans had literature until recently. Books on deerskin called codex
or codices. Books with images painted with glyphs.
<p><b>Dresden Codex</b>--AD 900-1300. Almanac with lunar table, planets,
sun.
<p>Books were burned and elders were executed, artifacts were lost. They
did have a recorder alphabet.
<p>Phonetic systems that had symbols that mean words.
<p>Today over 90% of Maya glyph system can be translated.
<p><b>Platform mounds</b>---large constructions built by native Americans
<p><b>Myths and Moundbuilders</b> (video)
<p>Bias has been a critical factor in research funding.
<p><b>Heliocentric--</b>centered on the sun.
<p>Germans believed you could draw circle around Egypt and tell the rate
of civilization spread out to the rest of the world. Raced based theory
in cranial size and intelligence.
<p>Marshall believed that the moundbuilders were skilled in math and surveying.
Others felt that the Indians were not the builders of the mounds that there
must have been an extinct race.
<p>Late 1700's in Ohio valley proof that North American history as rich.
The beliefs were still that the Indians killed off the moundbuilders. The
excavations produced pottery, copper, and remains of builders. Skulls were
scientifically measured. Conclusion: the moundbuilders and Indians were
the same race.
<p>The Europeans didn't want to believe that the indigenous people were
civilized.
<p>Squire and Davis--two men, who mapped, surveyed, classified, and recorded
what they found.
<p>Mounds have been looted for artifacts.
<p>Spanish and French explorers knew and recorder and described among other
things the well developed agriculture
<p>Lost race belief: Cyrus Thomas given job of solving the mound mystery.
Concluded that the mounds were built by Indians, found stone slab graves,
etc. (Faulk)
<p>Thomas also used historical links and found a direct link between mounds
and the Shawnee. He found two different moundbuilding cultures:
<p><b>Hopewell Culture</b> (2000 y. a.) Research center did salvage archaeology
because of a highway going right through the area.
<p><b>Mississipian</b> (1000ya): square, flat-topped.
<p>Artifacts found all over continent suggest trade network.
<p>Archaeologists wanted to find out how long it took to build mounds.
They brought in baskets of soil for flat thin surface, lined burial hole
with dry leaves and leather patches, and put in different materials to
see how long they survive. They were lined with wooden logs, mound of reeds,
limestone slabs. Some threw baskets of dirt, others dumped in piles. They
were able to build in one afternoon. These student built mounds may become
useful for future digs.
<p>The Indians ate fish, squirrel, raccoons. Walnuts and other nuts were
important. They were hunter-gatherers, using mortars and pestle for grinding
nuts for soup. They worked copper and had tool kits. Fishing line, copper
hooks, gourds as floats. Much of the food was waterfowl and fish. When
the water dried up in summer, backwater lakes were easy harvests of fish
using nets. Ground goosefoot plants seeds into flour. Plant debris has
been found in these archeological. sites. They removed the husks and boiled
the seeds to eat. These people were relatively healthy. The Hopewell period
seeds were bigger, suggesting the invention of agriculture, greatly increasing
productivity and supporting large groups, leaving plenty of spare time
to build mounds.
<p>The end of the Hopewell culture could have been from importing corn
from South America. The old patterns were broken, people spread out, increased
populations. Before corn there was heavy wear on teeth, yet the people
were healthy. After corn, there was very little wear on teeth, they had
cavities, they also decreased protein consumption. Change also saw an end
to the creative and artistic efforts. Replaced by newer techniques of moundbuilding.
Monk's Mound took 200 years. On top is the center of religious activity.
Massive posts in stockade for defense. Ruling elite lived on top of mounds
with 50,000 people living around. Continuous group labor projects. The
elite were dressed and adorned to set them apart. They had ceremonial axes
and pipes. Status. People received corn in return and told when and what
to plant.
<p>1500's : Mississipian culture declining
<p>Racism was inherent in the myths. The mathematical layout in structures
was advanced. Indians not even given credit. Archaeology cannot divorce
itself from its own culture.
<p>Ongoing development is endangering these areas of historical value and
significance. The challenge archaeologists have is in identifying these
important sites before they are lost to development.
<p><b>Artifacts:</b> Things modified by humans that tell us a lot about
a site.
<p>Inventive thinking: What led early humans to take one bone and a rock
and smash them against each other.
<p>Stone tools and material culture and how it changes over time gives
us an indication of how humans have changed. Humans have adapted to environments
and culture through change. Dress styles, for example have become shorter
during times of prosperity
<p><b>Codex: </b>invented in Mexico, ancient manuscripts. The primary function
of the overall format was to tell a story. Manuscripts read from right
to left from top to bottom. Some of the symbols had shells and water indicating
sea travel.
<p>Crescent Rock Shelter, Colorado: a Native American site where the Rockies
meets the high plains. Auger soil samples used because site is to become
a golf course so time is important element. First humans 11,000 ya.
<p>Cortex: the natural skin of a rock before flaked. The Indians created
stone tools using indirect percussion using antlers. Peeled away piece
by piece.
<p>Dorsal: exterior
<p>Ventral: interior
<p>Hafting: done so a narrow shaft could be attached
<p>Distal: top
<p>Proximal: bottom
<p><b>Chichen Itza: </b>Yucatan 650-1250 AD. Prosperous with land and maritime
resources, Louisiana, central and South American trade. People were of
various colors.
<p>Many cities were abandoned. Swidden agriculture: slash and burn. Unreliable
form of agriculture. Lived in fear. (fatalistic)
<p>Augustus Le Plongeon--mid 1800's. Began chopping away vegetation wanting
to connect ancient Maya with modern people. Found figure known as Chac
Mool (red jaguar). Limestone carvings. Dug them up and developed a story
line. It is a reclining man or warrior flat on back with feet on floor.
<p>Believed that ancient continent slipped between seas in Caribbean. Lemuria.
Sunk because gods forsaken. Others say that Lemuria is in the Pacific.
It had to be the origins of these civilizations. Idyllic, utopian societies--only
vestiges left.
<p>Houses were built on massive platforms to separate them from commoners
and to observe the horizon. All ancestors were considered to live in the
underworld. Monuments were very sacred. They represented Milky Way, planets,
etc.
<p><b>Speculative period:</b> 1400-1840 (Le Plongeon toward end of) Europeans
in contact and conflict with Native Americans. Spaniards rampaging through
New World. Speculative judging of the people they slaughtered.
<p><b>Descriptive Period</b>: 1840-1910 they went through and plundered
sites, described things along the way.
<p><b>Historical Period</b>: 1910-1940 Chronology, scientists were preoccupied
on building for native cultures. 1940's--Germans plundered many sites.
Hitler believed by collecting powerful artifacts he would gain power.
<p><b>Explanatory Period</b>: 1940-Present. Began to transform and question
like never before. Only elite societies studied up until then. Archaeology
began looking at what was around the palaces. Noticed warriors since many
had fought in WWII. Migration theories--pre 1940.
<p><b>Dioramas</b>: mock ups of what ancient cities looked like
<p><b>Flintknapping: </b>obsidian used mostly because it is elastic and
brittle, also used chalcedony, jasper, etc. Hit flake at oblique angle,
striking above ridges. If you understand how the stone breaks, you can
produce the results you want. For hunting needs, a sequence of stone tools
were needed. Multi-purpose tools were used. The first tool was wrapped
in leather to keep from breaking or chipping. Then modify it when needed.
Must carry along a hammerstone, moose, deer, or elk antler. Skinning will
dull the obsidian blade quickly. Therefore, more flakes are removed from
piece. Strike at the sharp edge and change to antler to make serrated edge
for removing meat from bone. A more durable tool was needed to strip the
meat. Thin the stone and straighten the edge. Scrapers were used to soften
hides. In understanding the process, you would be able to read the flakes.
Scrapers can be turned into spear points with a modified piece of antler.
Ninety-nine percent of human technology has been expressed in stone tools.
Flake, flake blade, serrated edged cutting tool, bifacial knife. Most of
the best obsidian comes from Lassen County. Striking angle is critical
in making stone tools.
<p><b>Munsell chart</b>: used to describe alphanumeric description of colors
<p>Fracturing properties are important. As with obsidian, when hit, shock
waves travel down, stone breaks along that line.
<p>Hammerstone used for hard hammer percussion. Antlers are used for soft
hammer percussion.
<p><b>Bulb of Percussion: </b>thickest part of stone. This is a critical
part of determining whether stone is naturally broken or man-made.
<p>Distal: pointed end
<p>Proximal: lower, wider part
<p>Impact point; waves of force; flake blanks; point preforms
<p><b>Debitage:</b> Flakes left over around tool making site.
<p>Some flakes are retouched or unretouched. If edges not prepared, then
the fracture can go in any direction. Preforms should be parallel.
<p>Basket making culture. Anasasi--Hopi are descendants.
<p>Ceramics are often the most durable artifacts.
<p><b>Kivas</b>: ceremonial subterranean structures built of stone. Towers
were connected by tunnels to kivas. Could have been for stargazing or defense.
<p>800-900 years ago, cliff dwellers, Choco Canyon. Agriculture based civilization.
Some kivas were 100 feet across. Massive apartments
<p>Pueblo Bonito: 800-1175 AD.
<p><b>Ancient Mission Documents</b>
<p>Request forms: asking for items such as calendars, vestments, staturaries,
and paintings of SJB. Sent orphans to populate, along with prisoners, blacks.
Incentive to violent prisoners in exchange for freedom. Most of the people
sent had very little status in Mexico. The documents show that the Spanish
friars took very good care of the children. The inventories being sent
to Mexico for requests included clothing for the kids, chocolate, and then
after awhile they were requesting alcohol, etc. Mission Indians were given
protection, meals, housing, pots/pans, moving forward in status as cowboys.
<p>In San Juan Bautista, documents related to Father Arroyo la Questa who
learned native language from interacting with Indians. Named and baptized
kids using names of Greek philosophers. Tried to get incarcerated Indians
released in Monterey. The padres dealt with all the problems. In 1816 all
letters refer to the Mexican Revolution.
<p>Forced enculturation. Brutal methods were used for non-compliers. In
Texas the heads of Apache warriors were placed at the entrance to presidios.
The presidios were fortresses to protect against the natives, British,
etc. The function was to control the region and keep it stable from being
attacked by outsiders. Neophytes created hostilities between tribes.
<p>Cahokia, IL: lush area of Mississippi Valley. Lakes made by native Americans
surrounded by massive mounds. 700-1400 AD settlement based on agriculture
and trade. Making woodhendge structures. Used for calendar and map. Like
Stonehendge.
<p>Ceremonial platforms (mounds) were specific for burying elite. Monk's
mound was 100 feet high. The core of the city was surrounded by a stockade.
Fortress. The city was laid out on a true north/south, east/west axis.
The thatched roof structures resembled the Mayas. Woodland tradition. Fancy
pottery, hand axes, dart throwers. The primary export: copper, axes. These
were a symbol of authority. Shell necklaces imported from Mexico. The mound
consists of 22 million cubic feet of earth.
<p>Ethnocentric views of Indians even when all variables present to represent
complex society.
<p>Video of mission restoration in Tucson, AZ. It cost several million
dollars to restore. Sonoran desert. San Xavier de Bac (Divine Mission)
The bricks were dissolving due to rain and weather. Separation of church
and state make funding impossible. This structure was elaborate and built
in Apache territory. Conservation began in 1989. Before that, concrete
was used to make repairs, but it was bad because it retains moisture. Instead
they used natural mortar, the same as the original builders (lime/sand
based plaster).
<p>The conservators respected the integrity of the art and trained people
to care for and take over the mission after the experts left. They removed
grime over paintings and moistened cracking art with water and adhesive
and coaxed them back in place.
<p>Some of the original art may have come from Central America. Expression
of culture lends importance to this site. Many shrines and murals of the
Virgin Mary. Mysticism indicated. Imagery based on spiritual genealogy,
hierarchy.
<p>1995 repair on the main altar. Patron Saint of Spain. Vision of heaven.
<p>San Francisco Xavier: Jesuit missionary. Yearly feast in honor of. Everyone
must be fed.
<p>The mission building must be maintained and as long as people are around
to take care of it, it will last.
<p><b>Virtual Dig: </b>This was an exercise in preparing grant and research
proposals.
<p>Budgets: food, accommodations, travel, equipment, salaries, autos, etc.
<p>Salaries seem to make up the largest amount of the proposal. Once the
proposal is submitted, it is reviewed by a panel (anonymous panel of colleagues)
<p>Included in the research are the Principal Investigator, Specialists,
Lab supervisors, Field supervisors, Site crew, Lab crew, Support crew,
cook, theodolite operator, and assistants. The amount of people needed
must be decided along with the amount of excavation units, availability
of housing, etc. Primary site datum: primary access of site
<p><b>Garbology:</b>
<p>Video<b>: Food to Die For (1994) </b>Dr. Mendoza. Humans tend to underreport
our own diet habits when bad. We maximize others eating faults. People
usually think they are eating better than they are. Many things are composted,
run down the garbage disposal and recycled. The things that don't spoil
and can be easy to identify like bottle caps, pull-tabs, and vegetable
bags. Pull-tabs used to be distinctive, but today they are attached to
the cans. Some people may not be aware of the amount of consumption and
others don't want to admit to themselves.

<br>An explanation for this could be that community colleges have more

<p>Historical Sites Archaeology
<p>Industrial Archaeology
<p>Ethnoarchaeology
<p>Experimental Archaeology
<p>Modern Materials Archaeology
<p><b>Fringe effect</b>: outside the edge, used specifically in archaeology
(Binford) when creating stone tools a fringe effect is also created. Eating
meat and tossing bones around would create a trash circle around each person.
Where there is a hearth, a trash horizon can be found around it.
<p><b>Good Provider Syndrome:</b> the person who prepares the food usually
exaggerates the health foods eaten. Leaves out mentioning junk foods to
give an impression of being a good provider.
<p><b>Lean Cuisine:</b> frozen healthy dinners, people underreport fast
food, chocolate, chips, etc. Over-report eating fruits and vegetables.
<p><b>Miasmic Theory of Disease: </b>a belief that smelling trash could
cause disease. Trash often buried in pits.
<p><b>Surrogate Syndrome:</b> When people provide inaccurate consumption
habits about selves, yet when discussing someone else's habits they will
tend to exaggerate the bad traits.
<p><b>Historic Sites Archaeology</b>: What is going on at SJB. Some believe
that archaeology has no place in history. History pertains to the facts
about the past. Historical archaeology fills in the gaps, which aren't
written down. Written documents are often underreported about daily activities
with Indians. Often selective about information written.
<p><b>Industrial Archaeology</b>: Documents of how movements of one technology
to another occurred. Arch. of the Industrial Age.
<p><b>Prehistoric Archaeology: </b>indicates no history, unwritten language,
etc. Not true.
<p><b>Experimental Archaeology</b>: attempts to replicate how stone tools
were made, used, etc.
<p><b>Modern Materials Culture: </b>looking at groups in our own society
from an archaeologist point of view. Includes study of garbage, styles,
cars, gangs,etc.
<p><b>Urban Materials Culture</b>
<p>Prehistory involved horses and whatever could be used to harness as
energy. Mexican cowboys have long history. Became modern day cowboys.
<p>Art was and still is used as an inspiration in urban city areas and
barrios. Often political statements, and some history represented by murals.
Intended to reach non-readers.
<p>Zoot suit riots of 1930's and 40's.
<p>Car clubs often associated with ethnic groups, especially low-riders.
Vintage automobiles, involving long restoration process. Often clash with
police because of the assumption and association with gang activity. Low
cars, drive slow and an alternate trend of mostly whites driving fast high-riders.
Low riders often involved in social activities, ethnic, parades, status
enhancements. Car clubs will often focus on one type of car. There is more
interest in these cars now than there were in the 70's. Many low-rider
murals. Most of the artists are self-taught. Some of the murals damaged
by rivals, Nazis, paint huffers.
<p>Images even on autos, many representing religious themes, figures, roses
(Virgin of Guadalupe) Many women represented. Some of the signature items
are wrought iron grilles, chain steering wheels, and glass etching, special
club nameplates, which can only be obtained by members. Member rules are
usually very strict. Members must not be in trouble with law, etc. There
is a lot of material culture identifying these groups.
