<P>      I enrolled in SBSA 224s/324s because of my interest in archaeology, anthropology, and just playing in the dirt. I have really been enjoying this course and plan on taking more classes of this type here at CSUMB. I am also very interested in the museum aspects of the field, in restoration, and in research. I have enjoyed all the videos and slides that we have seen in class. There is a lot to be learned and I have felt a little overwhelmed in general. The videos, stone tools, slides, and hands on experience have been very helpful in understanding the concepts, techniques, and just being able to picture the lives of past peoples.  I thought the flintknapping film was even fascinating.  I have always has an interest in American Indians since I have Cherokee and Choctaw ancestors.  Since viewing the videos and slides, I have also become very interested in the Mayan sites and culture.  The last slides about the mounds were also quite interesting. I was unaware of their existence. This class has shown me how much I don't know and how much there is to be learned.</P>
<P>&#9;One of the things I have learned is that note taking or journal entries are very important. I have taken plenty of notes on the videos and slides, but need to make improvements on my journals. I have forgotten many things at the San Juan Bautista Mission that I did not write down. It is very crucial to keep accurate and detailed notes on everything.  That is probably one of the most important things I have learned so far in this class.  My journal entries could be better. I am having a hard time adjusting to the way things are done here at CSUMB. This is only my first semester here, so I don't really feel comfortable yet. My attendance has been good so far. I have only missed one class meeting due to illness and one of the Mission digs for the same reason. I really enjoy going to the Mission and digging. We haven't come across much yet, but we expect to. The further down we dig; more things are turning up. Last time we were finding a lot of bones, and burned items. It was better after having soaked the ground the night before. That made it much easier to see things as well as easier to dig. It was also nice to not have to breathe the dust during the screening. I think that some instruction on digging etiquette should be available to students. Another thing is that a lot of Thursday lab time has been wasted due to lack of organization and student absences. Instead of wasting all your time re-lecturing to the students who missed the exercise, maybe one of the other students familiar with the procedure could bring them up to date, while others are helping set up the room for more flintknapping. It just seems like a lot of time is being wasted while you are running around trying to do it all.</P>
<P>All is all, this class is really fun and I plan on taking more like it. My performance and contribution will most likely improve as I gain more knowledge and competence. </P></DIR>
