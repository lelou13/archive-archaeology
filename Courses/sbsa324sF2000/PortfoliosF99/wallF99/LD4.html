<br><b>Excavation Methods Review</b>
<p>Stratigraphy: The soil levels and strata distinguished by differences
in color and texture, at a site, and how these are associated with each
other and the cultural aspects of the site.
<p>Soil Analysis: Some of the soil from an excavation is collected for
further study in the laboratory. Among the types of analysis would be for
flora and fauna information.
<p>Screening: A method used where soil is sifted through a screen in order
to single out smaller items that might be overlooked in the excavation
process such as beads, bone fragments, etc.
<p>Features:&nbsp; items such as fire hearths, artifact concentrations,
sleeping and eating areas that can be found at excavation sites.
<p>Test pits: Metric square areas used to determine whether or not an area
is a good area to excavate. Three- dimensional control must also be maintained
in test pits. Exploratory excavations.
<p>Datum Point: A fixed point where all other site measurements are taken
from.
<p>Research Design: A systematic transect sampling strategy. A method of
random sampling.
<p>Excavation Tools: In the past, pick and shovel were used, then backhoes,
and now excavation tools include remote sensing such as aerial photography,
soil resistivity, ground penetrating radar, and proton magnetometry.
<p>Instrument Maps: maps made by using technologies such as soil resistivity
surveys. Water content is measured and high density areas such a foundations,
paths, and roads tend to hold more water.
