<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The two data sets I have
represented in bar graph form are B13 and J11. Each column represents a
batch of debitage collected that falls into size increments in centimeters,
as shown with the x-axis of the chart beginning with &lt;1 centimeters
up to 7-9 centimeters. The y-axis shows increments of 5 units representing
both grams (weight) and centimeters (size). These two charts show the relationship
between the size of the pieces and their different type of material (jasper)
which has a different weight than obsidian. The weight of the jasper is
shown in blue and labeled weight – A in the key. Also in the chart for
B13, there is a green bar that goes off the chart. This was a very heavy
piece found in the 7-9 cm category. I decided not to make the chart big
enough to show the exact size visually since its ration to the other weights
is obviously of significant difference.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>With further analysis,
this data could be used to infer possible tool use. By looking at the size
and weight of the debitage and where it landed, many theories can be drawn,
such as where the flintknapper was sitting and what he was possibly creating.
A lot of tiny flakes in one area would indicate that the flintknapper possibly
finished a tool nearby since he (or she) would be doing finishing touches
in finer detail evidenced by small flakes. This would also mean that the
tool would not be present since the flintknapper would have taken it away
to use it. A large piece found could indicate that the flintknapper found
the shape or other quality of the stone undesirable or was interrupted
from his flintknapping before he could finish the piece.</font></font></b></blockquote>
