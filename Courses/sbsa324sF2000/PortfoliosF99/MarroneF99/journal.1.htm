                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I found the flintknapping experiment very fascinating. I also found that hands on projects make it easier for us as students to grasp the material. This hands on experience was very interesting because I have always wanted to know how arrow heads and other stone tools were actually made.  Its not as hard as it looks either.  In the lab I was able to make a variety of tools from a scraper tool to a projectile point.  Until now I never knew that obsidian was that easy to work with and I never expected it to be that sharp.  With the right angle and force I was able to  make a blade sharp enough to cut through a thick piece of leather and almost through my glove.  </FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The video showed how easy and prescise manufacturing stone tools really is.  By knowing and understanding the dynamics of a stone, a person can create a variety of tools for different jobs.  If one relizes were to hit the stone and with how much force needs to be applied, then the stone can be minipulated to the persons advantage.  I found the whole process and concept of flaking fascinating.  I never relized that you could transform a single piece of stone into several tools by simpling knowing the angles of the stone.  By simply adjusting the angle of your hammer stone, you can turn a scraping tool into a serrated edge for cutting.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">#1.08- This piece is light gray almost white with the tip being a tan color.  Also throughout the piece are tiny dots of tan coloring.  The tip has been broken off and it is around an inch long and around 2 cm at it's widest point.  The sides are slightly jaged and the bottom ( not the tip ) is also slightly jaged but is also curved inward.  It has a smooth arrowdynamic texture and design and was probally used for the tips of arrows or small spears used for hunting or warfare.  It is to small to cut meat but could have been used to cut smaller objects.#4.5- This piece is a dark brown almost red in color with faded yellow streaks running through it which is the different strada.  It could be made out of Churd or petrified wood.  It is around 3 inches long and around 3 cm wide.  It is much denser and heavier by comparison to piece # 1.08.  The tip is still intact and the sides are sharp and slightly jaged.  The bottom is curved inward and is also jaged.  It has a ridged surface with small indentations thoughout.  This piece is not arrowdynamic and seems to be to heavy to be placed on an arrow but would be ideal for a spear head.</FONT></P>

The stone tools indicate that they made their own tools, the trade beads tell us that they traded with other cultures, and the Bovine tooth means that the cow was a big part of their culture.  This also must have been a sacred site of worshop or even a trading site.  It might have also been the site for human and animal sacrifice.</FONT></P>

Before you even start digging you need to submit a proposal.  In this proposal you need to consider number of people involved, the wages of people involved, insurance, number of tools you are going to need, sleeping arrangments, transportation, food, length of time in the field, number of units in the site.  The exercise shows us that every little detail must be taken into consideration, the littlest details might hurt your chances of recieving that proposal.  However it is easier to resubmit a proposal in a simulater than it is in real life.</FONT></P>

They were used for ritual and burial purposes where the most important person was buried in the center and the least important were buried around that person.

                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If I was incharge of restoring a historical building or monument I would make sure that I did not add or delete anything that the original artist did not intend to be there. I feel that restoration is extremely important to our historical sites but there should always be some sort of balance.  Barely shaping or simply touching up a piece so that it will be preserved.  Restoration should be nothing more than that, simply protecting the pieces from damage, not attempting to repaint or sculpt according to modern standards and appeals.  If you drastically change a historical piece you are dimenishing every thought and feeling the original artist put into the piece.  You are essentially changing or distroying the artists message.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I feel that the restoration that is taking place at mission San Xavier Da Blanc is very interesting.  I think it is very important that we keep our historical buildings from being damaged.  This mission is most likely extremely important to the community in which it is located and probably brings in lots of tourism.  Not only is the money that these sites bring in important but the historical and religious aspects as well.  However there should be a balance in these restorations were the original settings should be seen as it originaly was.  Another words not adding or deleting any pieces to meet present societies needs.  These types of buildings are the foundations to our present society.  They were the building blocks and helped shaped and define this state.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">  Maps are an important part to many different areas in archaeology.  They allow archaeologists to rediscover as well as discover different historical sites.  They aid in the serveing procedure of dense land areas. If the map is layed correctly than a site of interest will never be lost, even if the trails that lead to that site have been covered over.  It is not only that map that helps but also the compus as well. The compus allows archaeologists to determine magnetic north and get a sence of were they are in relationship to their surrondings. The compus is another way to ensure that a site will not be lost.</FONT></P>
