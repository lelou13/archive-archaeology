very fascinating. I also found that hands on projects make it easier for
us as students to grasp the material. This hands on experience was very
interesting because I have always wanted to know how arrow heads and other
stone tools were actually made. Its not as hard as it looks either. In
the lab I was able to make a variety of tools from a scraper tool to a
projectile point. Until now I never knew that obsidian was that easy to
work with and I never expected it to be that sharp. With the right angle
and force I was able to make a blade sharp enough to cut through a thick
piece of leather and almost through my glove.&nbsp;</font></td>

<td BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial">The video showed how easy and
prescise manufacturing stone tools really is. By knowing and understanding
the dynamics of a stone, a person can create a variety of tools for different
jobs. If one relizes were to hit the stone and with how much force needs
to be applied, then the stone can be minipulated to the persons advantage.
I found the whole process and concept of flaking fascinating. I never relized
that you could transform a single piece of stone into several tools by
simpling knowing the angles of the stone. By simply adjusting the angle
of your hammer stone, you can turn a scraping tool into a serrated edge
for cutting.</font></td>

almost white with the tip being a tan color. Also throughout the piece
are tiny dots of tan coloring. The tip has been broken off and it is around
an inch long and around 2 cm at it's widest point. The sides are slightly
jaged and the bottom ( not the tip ) is also slightly jaged but is also
curved inward. It has a smooth arrowdynamic texture and design and was
probally used for the tips of arrows or small spears used for hunting or
warfare. It is to small to cut meat but could have been used to cut smaller
objects. #4.5- This piece is a dark brown almost red in color with faded
yellow streaks running through it which is the different strada. It could
be made out of Churd or petrified wood. It is around 3 inches long and
around 3 cm wide. It is much denser and heavier by comparison to piece
# 1.08. The tip is still intact and the sides are sharp and slightly jaged.
The bottom is curved inward and is also jaged. It has a ridged surface
with small indentations thoughout. This piece is not arrowdynamic and seems
to be to heavy to be placed on an arrow but would be ideal for a spear
head.</font></td>

excavating a site is not as easy as I had previously thought. It is more
than just digging and finding artifacts. Before you even start digging
you need to submit a proposal. In this proposal you need to consider number
of people involved, the wages of people involved, insurance, number of
tools you are going to need, sleeping arrangments, transportation, food,
length of time in the field, number of units in the site. The exercise
shows us that every little detail must be taken into consideration, the
littlest details might hurt your chances of recieving that proposal. However
it is easier to resubmit a proposal in a simulater than it is in real life.</font></td>

I feel that restoration is extremely important to our historical sites
but there should always be some sort of balance. Barely shaping or simply
touching up a piece so that it will be preserved. Restoration should be
nothing more than that, simply protecting the pieces from damage, not attempting
to repaint or sculpt according to modern standards and appeals. If you
drastically change a historical piece you are dimenishing every thought

changing or distroying the artists message.</font></td>

that these sites bring in important but the historical and religious aspects
as well. However there should be a balance in these restorations were the
