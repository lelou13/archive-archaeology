<center><u><font size=+3>Archaeology Laboratory Experiment: Map Sampling</font></u></center>

<p><br>
<p><font size=+1>It is through the use of maps that an archaeologist locates
her site, but once the site has been reached, there could be anywhere from
a few meters to a few hectares worth of land to survey. Obviously, this
presents a problem, in terms of both time and money, since an archaeologist
would probably not have unlimited time to neither discover <i>all </i>the
artifacts at a particular location, nor would she have the funding for
such an endeavor. Therefore, an archaeologist must use techniques to limit
his data while at the same time allow enough room for exploration to discover
artifacts over a broad scale. Unfortunately, this produces another quandary,
by virtue of the fact that by limiting data, an archaeologist limits her
ability to produce an accurate picture of the people she is studying. She
must <i>sample </i>the map, and do so in a way that she feels, guesses
or theorizes would provide the most data during the time allotted.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>A few sampling strategies tried in the class were random
sampling, transecting, prediction sampling and stratified sampling. Random
sampling is picking a few squares from the map totally at random. Obviously,
this strategy offers the least promise for accuracy, since the archaeologist
is doing little but blundering her way around the site in hopes of finding
something. Transecting a site is picking a series of cells in line on the
map grid and walking along them, looking for anything that might seem to
be of an artificial nature. This offers quite a bit more promise for accuracy,
especially if the transect is chosen carefully. Prediction sampling is
the selecting of map cells according to how people may have lived on the
land; i.e., near water or food sites, on top of hills, etc. This offers
a good chance of accuracy as well, but only if the people conform to modern
conceptions and standards. Finally, a stratified sample is taken by filtering
out data already gathered from a specific site and selecting map-squares
that have not been previously surveyed in order to build on a theory, or
find new evidence.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Random Sampling:</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>I did not actually choose squares at random, because I
felt that would be a waste of time. However, I did pick certain squares
on 'gut' feeling. They are as follows:</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>A9, B12, J12, L9, M7, M8, O7, O10, U3 and V6. Considering
the information available to me at the time, I thought perhaps these would
give me a broad idea of the site. Unfortunately, out of all the squares,
V6 was the only one that had any evidence of habitation. 10% success rate.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Transecting:</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>I picked the following transects because they were areas
that covered the largest amount of structures and known sites in their
paths. They are as follows: J, V, 8, 9 and 12. Both Transect V and Transect
9 ran straight through a sites containing massive evidence. 40% success
rate.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Prediction Sampling:</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>By first taking into account the fact that Xochicalco
was a settlement during the Epiclassic period, a time of constant warring,
I selected squares that I believed would show evidence of possible attack.
I looked at the map as an attacking warlord would and selected squares
that would be in the main avenues of assault (without repeating squares
already picked randomly) They are as follows: A8, A12, J11, K10, L7, L11,
M6, O11, U2 and V5. Both U2 and V5 had evidence, but none of the rest had
anything. 20% success rate</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Stratified Sample:</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>After making all of these decisions, I selected squares
I believed were without "noise", so to speak. The following squares seemed
to hold the most promise for dig sites, when taking into account the previous
evidence:</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>A9: It covers a large portion of settlement XF-215, but
also has a flat area just to the east of it, wide open to attack.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>J12: This covers a good section of the structure on the
hill. If invaders came in from the northeast, the grade of the hill to
the immediate northwest would provide an easy ascent for attacking armies.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>K9: It covers a courtyard-like section of another structure,
perhaps providing an insight into the city dwellers' lifestyle, as well
as providing information on whether this, the largest structure in the
area, was invaded.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>L9: A continuation of the structure from square K9, this
square also covers an area that an invading army might have marched down
after having attacked the structure at J12. Being jjust to the west of
a land-bridge with ravines on either side of it, this area was in the path
of such an attack.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>M7: Another structure atop this hill-complex. It would
provide further clues into the city-dwellers, and is also the only waypoint
between the large structure and the only shallow grade down to the river
running northwest of the hill-complex. Invading armies surely would have
come through here.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>O10: This covers the area of residence, XT-2. This may
have been bypassed by armies, due to its shelter in the lee of the main
hill. Investigation may prove otherwise, or may show how the people lived
before attack.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Unfortunately, 010 was the only site that showed any evidence.
10% success rating.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Considering the selections in the stratified sample, the
failure of finding much evidence goes to show I should have done more research
into the area and learned what had been discovered previously. Transecting
turned out to be my best bet--I would have had a much better chance of
success had I used that particular sampling strategy.</font>
