<p><b><i><font size=+2>Notes on "Myths and Moundbuilders"</font></i></b>
<p><font size=+1>Whites have been fascinated by the large earth structures—mounds,
ditches, dikes, etc.—of North America, and considered them not as proof
that the Indians were capable of organized society, but instead considered
them to be proof of a "lost white civilization". *snicker*</font>
<p><font size=+1>The mounds have been attributed to the Vikings, the Welsh,
the Lost Tribes of Israel, or even a stop made by the people on their way
to build the civilizations of Mesoamerica.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Morton’s use of craniometry showed that the moundbuilders’
skulls were almost exactly the same as those of modern Indians, so he fabricated
a story claiming that there were two races—a lost white race which had
been destroyed by the "barbarous" Indians. This fabrication was used as
justification by the white settlers to push the Indians off their homelands.
The land had originally belonged to the whites, hadn’t it? *snort*</font>
<p><font size=+1>A survey performed by Squire and Davis resulted in the
claim that most mounds were defensive ramparts. Artifacts were looted from
mounds while they were being ploughed under by expansionist farmers. Early
French and Spanish explorers described natives as living in an agricultural
society with leaders living on mounds of earth. The evidence could be construed
as backing up the Squire/Davis survey, but the "defensive ramparts" theory
was instead used to back up the theory that the lost white civilization
was wiped out by the "barbarous" Indians.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Faulk of Washington D.C. was allotted $5,000 by the U.S.
Congress to settle the question of the moundbuilders once and for all.
Thomas believed that the Indians did indeed construct the mounds and was
well aware that the belief in "lost white civilizations" was an addictive,
romantic fantasy. He proved connectgions between the mounds and the Indians.
Some of the largest mounds were destroyed in the building of St. Louis.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Two cultures did indeed exist, but none of them were white,
and they didn’t exist at the same time. They were the Hopewell (B.C. 100
– A.D. 100 or 200), who built conical mounds; and the Mississippian (A.D.
800 – A.D. 1200), who built flat-topped, pyramidal mounds for their chiefs
and temples.</font>
<p><font size=+1>An interstate will be built across sites in the way, so
modern archaeologists need to excavate quickly in order to salvage as much
as possible before the sites are destroyed. This process is called "salvage
archaeology". Artifacts were found that suggested a vast trading network.
The odyssey crew built a mound to find out exactly what sort of societal
impact that sort of construction would have had. This process is called
"experimental archaeology".</font>
<p><font size=+1>In order to further understand this, villages were excavetd
and their leavings examined. They worked copper, they constructed fishhooks
&amp; lines and hunted &amp; gathered also to understand how the Indians
may have done it. Sumpweed seeds were larger during the Hopewell period,
leading to the theory that the Hopewell Indians cultivated this plant through
the selection and cultivation of this particular plant. The archaeologists
estimated that there were approximately 50 people per square mile of river,
moer people than exist today with at least the same agricultural productivity
as today’s. Aslo, moundbuilding took relatively little effort. An average-sized
mound could be built in an afternoon, with about 40 people. The introduction
of maize (corn) changed the Hopewell culture. They became the Mississippians.
The people moved onto hills and populations increased, while general health
decreased as did artifacts. Larger mounds were created—Monk’s Mound, the
larges man-mae structure north of Mexico – a civilization of about 50,000
people ruled by a chiefly elite. Civilization &amp; nobility arose as a
result of the new maize-based civilization. Due to crop failures brought
about by overfarming and overpopulation, the civilization entered a decline
and began to collapse which the Spanish &amp; French explorers accelerated.
Racist theories then began to arise. Scientists and archaeologists need
explanations, so times and terminologies change, sometimes with more accuracy,
sometimes just to satisfy social theories and traditions. Thus arise the
creation of myths and legends.</font>
