<p><font size=+1>At this, the midpoint of the semester, I've accomplished
most of what I've tried to do. I've missed only a couple of classes, but
I feel interested in what's being taught; especially the flintknapping
portions of it. I've spent quite a bit of time working stone tools and
I definitely feel like I'm getting better at it. I haven't read as much
of the book as I should have, but I've spent quite a lot of time with VirtualDig
and have learned how to successfully organize an expedition and assemble
a budget. In my workings with obsidian, I've created a plethora of projectile
points and a few scrapers, as well as produced quite a few useable flakes.
I'm still having trouble with thinning and smoothing, but with practice
I'm sure I'll work past it.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>I've gone out to Mission San Juan Bautista once so far,
but I don't believe I'll be able to make it out again. I am not going to
be able to participate in that portion of the class, due to schedule constraints.
The trip to the Mission was an informative one, especially in the light
of being on-site at an actual archaeological dig. When comparing what I
saw at the site with the debitage-collection experiment done in the lab,
I'm definitely gaining a respect for the infinite patience an archaeologist
must possess.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>In conclusion, I think I'm doing adequately. I take notes
on the lectures and I enter them into the journal, as per the requirements.
As far as the lab deliverables and major projects go, I'm choosing the
aspects I'm interested in and I'm doing them with gusto. I could be working
harder bookwork, but I feel the concepts I've glanced over in the text
are being covered well enough during the lecture portion of the class.
All in all, I feel like I'm learning how to apply the scientific method
to my approaches in things, while at the same time remain an observer,
as is crucial in this particular field.</font>
