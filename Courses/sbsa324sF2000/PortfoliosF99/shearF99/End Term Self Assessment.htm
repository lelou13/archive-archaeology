</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P>&#9;Wow, that class went by so fast. I can’t believe that it is already over. I guess time flies when you’re having fun. And that is what this class was, fun. It is the end of the semester and I have learned so much.</P>
<P>&#9;When I started out in this class I had no idea what I was getting into. I even thought of dropping it after the first week. I have to say though that I am very glad that I didn’t. This has been one of the best classes that I have ever taken. It was interesting and I learned a lot of new information. I had chosen this class because it fulfills the science ULR and I don’t know if I would have picked it otherwise, but I am glad that I did.</P>
<P>&#9;I started this class not knowing what I was getting myself into. As we went along in the semester I felt that I was doing fairly well. I come to class all the time even though it is at 8 o’clock in the morning. I enjoy going to class because I know that I will always learn something new. This class has let me enjoy science once again. I don’t really like the traditional sciences such as chemistry and physics. I would much rather have a class such as archaeology for science. I think that throughout this course I have learned many things that will enrich my knowledge.</P>
<P>&#9;One part of the class I really enjoyed was going out to San Juan Buatista and actually participating in a field site. What I learned out there I could never have gotten from any book. I learned what it really took to work out in a field and keep digging and digging and not really finding what you are looking for. I had a lot of fun out at the mission. The people I worked with on my site were a lot of fun. We would make up stories about what happened, by the items we were finding in the dirt. In my site we made it to the second level but never recovered any of the foundation we were looking for. I had a lot of fun at the mission and got a lot out of it that I wouldn’t have if I just read a book, not to mention the fact that I don’t have to write a term paper. Although I think if I had written a term paper it would have been as good as actually participating in a real archaeology dig. Another part that I really enjoyed and fell that I put a lot of effort into was the stone tool lab. This lab was a lot of fun and was very interesting as well. I produced two tools that actually work for scraping and cutting. This lab was a hands on lab, which makes it do much easier for me to learn. When I watch a video about something I just don’t really get anything out of it. Whereas when I do hands on type of lab I really understand how to do the project or assignment. The stone tool lab was one of my best labs.</P>
<P>&#9;In my midterm self-assessment I said that my journal entries weren’t as good as I thought they could be. I feel that I have improved them, but I don’t think that I did what I was going to do. I know that I didn’t spend extra time on the entries like I said I would do so they are probably about the same as they were in the beginning of the year. I also said in my midterm that I was writing down what I learned at the mission each time I went out there, but that ended up not happening. I always posted my journal entries about going out there but I never kept a written journal in my notebook. I think that I have done what I said I would in my midterm and hope that I have improved sense the beginning of the semester.</P>
<P>&#9;I feel that I probably could have put more effort in to my journal entries, but some how that never happened, with all the other work I had to do. I feel that from this class I have learned a lot of new things and might even take more courses like this one in the future. Although I don’t think that I will make this my major, but I might consider it for my concentration in my major. </P>
<P>&#9;I have to say again that this class was very enjoyable and you are a great teacher for letting me see that science can be fun. Everything I have learned over the semester is very valuable and I am a more knowledgeable person because of it.</FONT> </P></BODY>
