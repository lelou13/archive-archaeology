<P>I thought that the flintkapping was a lot of fun and it really showed me what it took to make one. When I started I couldn't even break the stone I had to get some help with the first break. After that I was able to break more easily and started to get some pretty good flakes that would be usable as a stone tool. It is amazing how you can make the stone break where you want it to if you have enough experience. I started to get better at breaking it then when I went to make an actual tool I ran into some trouble. I found it very difficult to start breaking the tool to make it what I wanted it to be. I will try more the next time I pick up the tool. I guess with each time I will get better and better and will understand more how to get the tool to be what I want. </TD>

<P>1. The tools that were used in the search for the "Lost Spanish Mission" according to David Hurst Thomas was Random Sampling transect sampling strategy, gasoline powered posthole digger, and remote sensing. When using random sampling the archaeology team walks sections of the land. Walking in a series of east west transects each a 100 meters wide by using this method you cover a lot of ground and can maybe find a site. This isn't always the best way because you might end up never finding a site. There might not be anything on the surface that is why they use many methods. Using transect sampling you take a 20% randomized sample. You investigate each site digging test units to find any hint of artifacts. When using the Gasoline-powered posthole digger it throws up a sampling of dirt that can be used to find artifacts. This method is very helpful because it allows the archaeologist to sample a deep hole in a matter of minutes. This allows them to see if it is in fact a site. 2. Archaeologist dig strait holes and make strait lines because that way they can see the midden and can actually tell when someone was there and what type of things they eat and what they did. It is also easier to tell exactly where an artifact was found whereas if you dug a hole there would be less accuracy. When digging square holes it enables the archaeologist to give exact directions to a site. You have to take it slow or else you might miss something of importance or might break something. Drawing from my own experience out at Mission San Juan Buatista. By digging holes that are square it makes it easier to chart where we found an artifact. When cataloging the artifacts we found during the day we use N-10 W-38 NE ¼ this tells exactly where we were digging and then you can find the place that the artifact came from. </TD>

<P>In the video "Myths and Moundbuilders" myths about the moundbuilder were discussed. When the people came from europe they refused to believe that the American Indians could have possibly built such mounds. The Europians thought that they were to savage for that. They believed it must have been a lost tribe. A tribe that was passing through on their way to Central America, the vikings or other white groups. People were always trying to find ways to credit there thoughts. Archaeologists have dug up the mounds for many years trying to find the real truth. They have even built a mound of their own to see how the people were able to do that. The myths that were uncovered were helpful and it is about time that the American Idians were given the credit they diserve. </TD>

<P>My method of sampling was very inconsistant. For the first samples which were to be chosen at random, I chose areas where the lines on the map were most dense. I also chose sites that were next to eachother just in case there was somthing inbetween. I chose: R-5, S-5, K-3, L-3, H-7, H-6, N-9, N-8, G-6, and G-7 my reasoning for these was that I thought the more lines there are the better a chance I might have finding somthing on that site. When I chose my transects I just divied the map evenly by North-South. Transects: 3,6,9,12,and 15. By doing that I figured that each person would have the same amount to cover. I also thought that it would be easier to excavate. When I chose the next ten squares I chose them on the basis of where the river is located. When people make a settlement they usually tend to go to water. So I chose L-2, L-3, M-3, V-1, U-1, C-9, D-9 K-2, K-13, and L-13. I also chose some that were by another settlement. I chose them because I thought that there might be another one close by. I didn't have to factor out any noise because I chose only sites that were on the map. </TD>

<P>My methods for selecting sites didn't work to well. With almost all my selections I didn't hit one settlement. The only thing that worked was my choses for the transects. With those I hit two settlements on transect 3 and 9. My other picks didn't produce results at all.</TD>

<P>1.a) The Codex that was brought in described the history of a group of people. In this case it was the Mixtec culture. The format of the Codex is that it is read from right to left and goes up and down. b) The different pictures and colors that were used interpreted the Codex. The different symbols and haw the whole thing was put together. It was read from Right to left. c) We chose the section that showed a ladder going to a platform. This ladder had Eagle feathers on either side of it and it was going to a platform that we assumed was heaven. At the top of the platform there were gods and other symbolic items. The other items must be of significance to this culture and their Gods. d) The six items I choose were eagle feathers, red striped man, ax, circles, ladder, and a family tree. The Eagle feathers are for the red striped man who is going to be sacrificed by the ax. The circles are to show the date that the sacrificed occurred. The ladder is to show the way to heaven and the family tree is to show whom the person belonged to. </TD>
