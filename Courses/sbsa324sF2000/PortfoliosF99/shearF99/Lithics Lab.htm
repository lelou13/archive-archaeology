<P>For this lab I only took two sample squares. They were F-10 and D-4. In both my samples there were a lot of small pieces that were under 1 centimeter. This made it a little hard to pick up everything off the square. I managed though and I got all my information.</P>
<P>I had a hard time figuring out my chart. It wasn’t that I didn’t understand how to use excel, it’s just that I had a hard time trying to make all the information fit onto my chart the way I wanted it to. I eventually figured it out and think that they came out very well. Once I figured it out the rest of the charting was very easy.</P>
<P>&#9;From interpreting my chart for F-10 it seems that the Unit Square was very dense with pieces of flakes. There were many small pieces and only a few big pieces. When I look at my chart for the unit D-4 it seems to be the same thing. There are many pieces in the square that weigh very little. </P>
<P>&#9;If I wanted to recreate my two units I would probably use density as my factor and not weight because there are more pieces in each square. Whereas if you used weight you could put one big piece in and that wouldn’t be right. Doing this lab helped me understand how you would recreate a site with information. I </P>
<P>also understand now the importance of really looking at where you find debris. By really looking at the debris you can tell where a person was sitting and which hand they were using to make the stone tool.</P>
