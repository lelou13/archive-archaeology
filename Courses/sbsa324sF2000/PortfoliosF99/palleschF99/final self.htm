<P ALIGN="CENTER">Final Self-Assessment</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</FONT><P>&#9;&quot;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step.&quot; Well, I finally took the last step and finished this class. To get to the point, I really am not sure what I am suppose to have this assessment contain, so I am going to just use the same question from the mid-term assessment, and go from there.</P>
<P>&#9;To start, I had no reason to enroll in this class other than for a ULR. Pretty much at class registration, all the classes I wanted were full, and they gave me this class. Hence I really had no expectations, so everything we have done have hit my expectations. </P>
<P>&#9;As for participation goes I have tried to make all the classes, but I have missed a few. I think in my mid-term I said I would try and make more classes or something. But, I didn’t meet that goal. In addition to that, I have tried to ask questions and give full participation in class as well as out on the dig in San Juan Batista.</P>
<P>&#9;I think I have used the online journal extensively well. I have got almost every post to it, but maybe 1 or 2, and I have really elaborated well I think onto the journal. I think I said I wanted to talk more in my posts, and I think I have achieved that rather well. But, I am not quite sure seeing how it has been difficult to access the Journal lately. (The journal has been down and inaccessible)</P>
<P>&#9;The Dig has gone rather well, it’s a lot of grunt work, but all in all it is fun. I have learned a abundant amount of material and new approaches to the scientific theory. Though I still have 1-2 more digs to attend, so I will have to do a all day dig this Friday. I have kept pretty decent notes on the Journal, which I wanted to add to my portfolio, but it has been down. To add to that I have found some cool trinkets especially the jawbone with teeth in it. One thing I am sort of upset about is that you changed the amount of visits out to the dig. First you said only 5 trips then changed it to 6 after I got to 3 digs. I had planned to attend certain digs, cause it’s hard for me to make every Friday. Having 6 is going to make me have to go to a double this Friday. </P>
<P>&#9;I am suppose to talk about what I am going to do with my final report… but seeing how I don’t have a final report that would be rather difficult, so now onto the next question.</P>
<P>&#9;Some of the key concepts and skills I have learned: digging, sifting, Id’ing, and plain growth of knowledge in the archaeological field. Digging is almost a art form now for me. My technique works well now that we don’t have to dig into the hard cement like dirt. Having the rains has made it so soft and mushy that I dug almost as much in 1 morning as 3 other mornings combined. When I say sifting I really mean, &quot;sifting&quot; Sure it doesn’t sound like a skill, but now I know what to look for, unlike my first day out as a neophyte searching for buried treasure. Id’ing also know as Identifying. Along side sifting Identifying has come in handy, now I know a lot more about what I am digging up and am better at deciding whether it is needed to be kept or not. I remember having to ask, &quot;should I keep this?&quot; And basic knowledge, well that’s pretty self-explanatory. Going to class and listening to lectures pretty as well as reading I learned a lot of basic fundamentals for this field.</P>
<P>&#9;For the best labs… well I enjoyed banging rocks together. That was a blast, especially when you had this perfect blade, you chiseled it down and finally near the end you broke it in half by accident, &quot;damnit!!!&quot; Oh I really hated it when that happened. But it was fun to say the least. I don’t think I will become a professional flintnapper, but it was fun. To add I enjoyed the diggings out at San Juan. (Except for the blisters on my hands)</P>
<P>&#9;As for how I think the semester went and my improvement. I think I did pretty decent for the knowledge I attained and my out going participation went. I think that I could have done better in everything I did, but so could everyone else. I think I gave it a good effort and had fun doing it. Have a good Winter Break, and see you next year.</P>
