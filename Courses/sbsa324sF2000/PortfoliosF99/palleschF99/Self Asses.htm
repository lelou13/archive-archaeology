</B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><LI>To be frank, all my choices for classes were taken, and I had to take a science ULR. This was the only one left that sounded remotely interesting. Hence I took the class. Seeing how I came into the class with a low expectation, the class has completely met what I had dreamt for. To tell you the truth, I really enjoy the class and have accumulated a large amount of knowledge. I have to admit the lectures get me kind of sleepy, but all lectures tend to do that to me. In addition, I like the Friday dig it really gives you a first hand look at what being an "archaeologist" is.</LI></P>
<LI>Well, I have only missed one session of class. That was the lab day 2 on Flint Knapping. Other than that I have worked through all the material, and stayed heads up on all the work. I have tried to throw my hand up in your lectures to help exemplify your lectures. I have worked in groups to do a few of the small tasks, and I have written in the Class Journal every time the occasion has presented itself.</LI>
<LI>I have used the journal quite extensively. I have gotten all my points down, and believe I have done a decent job. Having this class journal has been my first experience. Most of my classes normally we turn in notes, or write a paper and bring it in the next day. This has been a good learning experience and I truly enjoy working with it. In my Prosem class we use one as well, but not quite as much.</LI>
<LI>–I am doing the Field Study, (San Juan Batista Dig). I haven’t learned a extreme amount of knowledge. But I have learned a new field of study and scientific method. Also, the art of using a pick ax, and brush. </LI>
<LI>Well, I am doing the Field Study. Pretty much, we go to 6 3-hour sessions, and then report what we did in the Class Journal, or our own personal notes. At the end we compile them within our Portfolio.</LI>
<LI>Well, I for one hate weighing out, cataloging all the items. But, it is a essential part of the process and must be done. Digging and sifting aren’t that great either, but all in all it’s worth it when you discover something cool. I think the experience is what really interests me the most. The whole thing as one, working as an "archaeologist" is what makes it fun.</LI>
<LI>Not having any real background in archaeology, (other than Dinosaurs) I really had no expectations for this class. Hence all the events that we have done have sparked some interest into me, and I have enjoyed them. Though, I might add a field trip in, per say to a museum. ("From map to museum")</LI>
<LI>I need to work on engaging the class with more sleep. It is a morning class and I tend to get less than 6 hours of sleep. I apt to not give full attention to the class. Also sometimes I come to class unprepared, like today Oct. 19. I forgot to bring this paper with me; hence I had to email it to you. I will try harder in that field. </LI></OL>
