<center><b>Lab Deliverable 6: Stone Tool Analysis</b></center>
</blockquote>

<b>Introduction:</b> The production of stone tools is an activity
that first appeared at the dawn of human culture.&nbsp; Because of the
virtually indestructable nature of the materials used -- mainly flint,
chert, and obsidian -- the residues of human stone tool production and
use can be preserved for literally millions of years.&nbsp; As such, we
have stone tools and related evidence from ancient East Africa of the first
human or hominid tool makers of some 2.5 million years ago.
<p><b>Directions:</b> This Lab Deliverable will entail two to three meetings
during which time you will be (a) introduced to the means by which stone
tools were crafted by ancient societies (Session 1: via video and a hands-on
demonstration by your instructor), and (b) via a hands-on stone tool experiment,
artifact mapping, and collection and quantification.&nbsp; Because we will
require a space adequate to the task of producing and documenting stone
tool production, Session 2 will take place in the Archaeology Lab in Building
110 (behind Module 86C, see Map).
<p><b>Session 1: Introducing Stone Tools:</b>
<p><b>1.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefully review the "Flintknapping" video
by Dr. Bruce Bradley and the "Ancient Cultures and Modern Chemistry" (ChemLab)
video (or the Fall 1997 SBSC 224sl/324sl flintknapping demonstration video).&nbsp;
Be prepared to take detailed notes (for submission with your final portfolio)
of the demonstration and the methods described.&nbsp; Your description
should be detailed enough to allow another person to use your notes to
learn about stone tool production methods.
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; After the video review and discussion, your
professor will provide examples and a hands-on demonstration of the types
of materials and tools used in the production of stone tools.&nbsp; You
should prepare notes based on your observations and your professor's demonstrations
of the tools and techniques noted.&nbsp; You should prepare responses to
the following questions based on based on both the video and the demonstration:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(a)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly identify and
define the following flintknapping methods: (1) hard-hammer percussion,
(b) indirect percussion, and (c) pressure flaking.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(b)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be prepared to discuss
why each of the aforementioned methods were used.&nbsp; In other words,
when and why would an ancient stone tool producer use "hard-hammer percussion
" versus "indirect percussion" versus "pressure flaking"?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(c)&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; How do archaeologists
go about distinguishing tool types one from the other?&nbsp; How do archaeologists
go about identifying the function of stone tools from archaeological sites?
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; How does "experimental
archaeology" figure into the study of stone tools?&nbsp; What value and
insights are offered by experimental archaeology in so far as the interpretation
and study of stone tools is concerned?
<p><b>Session 2: Creating and Interpreting Stone Tools:</b>
<p><b>1.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; For next week, please read and prepare notes
based on Chapters 6 and 7 in the Whittaker book "Flintknapping."&nbsp;
While Chapter 6 provides a basic introduction to the methods and techniques
of hard-hammer percussion, Chapter 7 provides an overview of pressure flaking.&nbsp;
Be prepared to distinguish the purposes and results of these two methods
of stone tool production.&nbsp; These notes will be required in your final
portfolio.
<p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Day One]: Meet at the usual class location,
and be prepared to go to the Archaeology Lab in Building 110 about one
half hour after the beginning of class.&nbsp; Upon arrival at the usual
class location, we will discuss the readings and take a roll call of all
students present for the trip to the Archaeology Lab.&nbsp; After the discussion,
we will proceed to the Archaeology Lab.
<p><b>3.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; [Day Two]: Because you will be handling
sharp stone tools materials, you are required to wear gloves and goggles
during the lab exercise.&nbsp; In addition, you should come prepared with
long pants so as to protect your knees from sharp obsidian glass fragments.&nbsp;
Please observe all precautions noted by your professor.
<p><b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the lab exercise, you will first
observe your professor's demonstration and take notes of any and all methods
used in the demonstration.&nbsp; You will be given an opportunity to experiment
with some of the stone tool material if you choose to do so.
<p><b>5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the demonstration, you will
be required to count, collect, and weigh the stone tool materials deposited
in a sample of the 20 cm x 20 cm grid squares located on the gridded tarp
used for the demonstration.&nbsp; As groups, you will submit your counts,
weights, and notes on the demonstration via the Online Journal or E-mail
to: ruben_mendoza@monterey.edu.
