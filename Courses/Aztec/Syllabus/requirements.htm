                    It should be noted that the basis for grading and assessment 
                    of this section might be subject to slight variation from 
                    what is noted below in the event that the class shifts its 
                    emphasis for the purposes of study options and those projects 
                    undertaken. Any changes will be subject to class discussion 
                    and consensus where appropriate.
                    <p><strong>Participation:</strong> Because this course will 
                      require your in-class participation in discussion, lab exercises 
                      (such as that of the Gamesmanship and the Art of Patolli or Tlachtli), 
                      and in your use of the Discussion Forum, 25 points of your 
                      final grade will be assessed by way of your attendance and 
                      participation. Participation will in part be assessed by 
                      way of the timely and thorough completion of (a) Online 
                      Journal or Discussion Forum entries completed on a weekly basis, 
                      and (b) the documentation of in-class Lab Deliverables (see 
                      below) via the Discussion Forum (<a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/phpbb2">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/phpbb2</a>) and by way of the submission 
                      of supporting class materials related to the Lab Deliverables 
                      (1 point each; or 20 points total).</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because in this instance most of the Discussion Forum entries will be completed outside of class, and 
                        will address class participation and lab exercises, it is 
                        critical that your participation be reflected in the Discussion Forums. In fact, your professor uses online 
                        and wireless journal entries to assess credit for participation. 
                        See online journals at: <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/phpbb2">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/phpbb2</a>. You are in turn required to provide both electronic and hardcopy versions of each and every one of your Discussion Forum entries. </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Finally, please note that much of what we cover in weekly 
                        labs will require that you to bring to each class the 
                        Miller and Taube (1997) text as said work contains much of that 
                        reference material, and terminology, that we will require for both lab and discussion periods. The Aztec Calendar Workshop is one such lab for which the Miller and Taube text will be required. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><strong>The Aztec Calendar Workshop:</strong> The Aztec Calendar Workshop will require that you maintain detailed notes of any and all observations or interpretations conjured during the course of any given workshop day. You should maintain a journal that documents the workshop. You should include in your journal diagrams or illustrations of key glyphs, icons, and monumental inscriptions, where appropriate, as one other way of presenting your information. Notes, illustrations, and diagrams from the Aztec Calendar Workshop will be submitted, along with your Final Portfolios, as one other measure of your participation in in-class labs and discussion group projects (see Participation for credit).</p>
                      <p><strong>Challenge Project Option: </strong>Because of the controversial nature surrounding the question of Aztec human sacrifice I have decided to opt for a final project offering that would pit you against the world of Aztec scholarship.&nbsp; If you would like to address either the question of (a) Aztec human sacrifice, or (b) Aztec militarism and empire building, you may do so with a thoroughly researched paper challenging the notion of either Aztec human sacrifice or warfare and empire.&nbsp; In order to begin this effort you would need to draw from works such as that of David Carrasco's <em>City of Sacrifice</em> and other reputable sources.&nbsp; If your effort is to challenge the existence of human sacrifice, you may draw on both traditional and non-traditional scholarly and non-scholarly resources.&nbsp; You are cautioned however to provide sufficient evidence so as to weigh the evidence both for and against your position.&nbsp; By taking on this project you will be allowed the option of foregoing, or not being required to complete, the Midterm/Endterm Reader Reviews and all five Reader Response papers.&nbsp; No Incomplete grades or assignments will be permitted in this instance. </p>
                      <p><strong>Patolli Game Competition:</strong> Patolli is an ancient Mesoamerican "board" game that will be introduced after midterm as a class competition. Competitors will target extra credit during the course of the competitions to be announced. Total possible extra credit for the first place finalist is 10% points of extra credit, and 5% for two second and third place runner ups. </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Lecture and Discussion Notes: </strong>You will be required to submit a complete set of handwritten and or typewritten notes at both midterm and endterm as one additional way of assessing your participation in class lectures and workshops. Failure to submit notes that reflect both lecture and discussion, and required readings, will result in the granting of an Incomplete or No Credit grade at the end of the term (15 points).</p>
                    <p><strong>Reader Response Papers:</strong> Approximately 
                      five typewritten and single-spaced two page  reader response papers will be completed by 
                      you and submitted in hardcopy with sufficient detail so that the instructor can 
                      assess your thorough completion and understanding of the 
                      readings assigned. The reader response papers will account 
                      for approximately 25 percentage points of your final semester grade. The reader 
                      response papers will be graded at 5 points each per minimum 
                      two-page essay if they demonstrate your thorough understanding 
                      and reflection of the readings. Three points will be assessed 
                      if a partial understanding of the readings are reflected, 
                      and one percentage point will be assessed if the essay was completed 
                      but did not reflect a clear understanding of the readings 
                      assigned (25 percentage points possible). The instructor will reserve the right to assess a No Credit for late papers (25 points total). </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may forego the Midterm Book 
                        Review through the submission of an additional five single-spaced one-page 
                        reader response papers, for a total of ten Reader Response 
                        papers for the term. The articles or chapters that you review will be 
                        selected in consultation with your professor beforehand, 
                        or may be of your own choosing from existing class resources; 
                        however, for those articles that you select from beyond 
                        existing resources, you must obtain approval from your professor 
                        prior to preparing reviews of articles not assigned in class.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Midterm/Endterm Book Reviews:</strong> 
                      A double-spaced, minimum five-page, midterm book review will be required as one other 
                      point of departure for your instructor&#8217;s assessment 
                      of your performance at midterm. The Coe and Koontz text will serve as the midterm review, and the Knab text will serve as the endterm selection for the midterm and endterm reader response or reviews. You may select from the Reader Response Options so as to replace one of those selections so noted (10 points eachl 20 
                      points total).</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may select from the list of Reader Response Options
                        as the basis for your End Term Oral Presentation or Final Project Report. In other 
                        words, if you read a book on Aztec blood sacrifice (e.g., Carrasco 1999), you may use that topic and what 
                        you learned by way of said review as the basis for your final oral 
                    presentation and report.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Midterm and Endterm Self Assessments:</strong> 
                      At midterm and end term each class participant will submit 
                      a self-assessment statement in which you respond to a series 
                      of questions about your overall performance to that respective 
                      point in the semester. The questionnaire for this exercise 
                      may be found at: <a HREF="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Guidelines/Questionnaires/SelfAssessment.pdf">http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Guidelines/Questionnaires/SelfAssessment.pdf</a> 
                      (10 points total).</p>
                    <p><strong>Final Project and Oral Narrative:</strong> Your 
                      end term scholarly objective or requirement is to submit 
                      a final project paper (of no less than 8 typewritten double-spaced 
                      pages not including bibliography and illustrations) with 
                      content based on your own research from reliable sources 
                      drawn from at least eight separate and distinct books and 
                      or articles (see Format Guidelines at Project Guidelines). I strongly 
                      encourage projects that derive directly from our in-class workshops, labs, and or related group exercises. The presentation 
                      formats for these final projects or presentations may be 
                      negotiated with your professor. The Oral Presentation in 
                      this instance should provide no more than a 5-minute overview 
                      of your learning experience specific to  those concepts examined in the course of your study (see Presentations 
                      guidelines). The Final Project and Oral Presentation or 
                      equivalent is worth 15 points towards your final grade (15 
                      points).</p>

                    <p> <strong>Classroom Expectations: </strong>
Please note that I reserve the right to forego granting Incomplete grades, except in those instances where a physician's (written) medical excuse has been offered as evidence for non-completion of all term work. As such, you are expected to submit your work on time.&nbsp; Because I will take attendance from time to time, and your participation in labs is required, please note that your attendance will not be counted if you are more than 10 minutes late to class.&nbsp; Where your professor's attendance is concerned, I will notify the class in advance of any days that might require my absence; except in the case of an unforeseen illness.&nbsp; In those instances where I may be late to class, I will notify one student by telephone on the morning in which the late showing might be necessitated.&nbsp; Otherwise, please do not hesitate to contact me by email at <a href="mailto:archaeology_institute@csumb.edu">archaeology_institute@csumb.edu</a> or by phone at 831-582-3760.</p>
                    <p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Please note that I am always happy to meet with you so long as you make arrangements in advance during the course of my office hours. Office hours for this term are scheduled for Thursday afternoons from 1:00 to 3:00 pm. If you require more than 20 minutes for an appointment, please notify me so that I can schedule you in accordingly. Contact me at <a href="mailto:archaeology_institute@csumb.edu">archaeology_institute@csumb.edu</a> for an appointment. Assume that I have accepted your proposed appointment time only in those instances where I have emailed you a confirmation in turn.
