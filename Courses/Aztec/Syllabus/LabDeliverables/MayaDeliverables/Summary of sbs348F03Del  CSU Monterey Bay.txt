Hello, I am not sure if this came through ok so I am sending it again.  My best friends uncle passed away this weekend so I was in the bay area, and my cousin also got married this weekend in LA so it has been a long week. I am sorry that I did not get a chance to check this earlier. I hope that I can still get credit for it. Thank you for your time.
I apologize for any inconvenience.

Sincerely,
  Trinity Shamrell

Because of personal problems, I have behind on my school work. Here are
the Chapters 1-2, and Chapters 3-4 from the Miller Book. I was also
wondering, if we had to turn in reading responses for the Martin & Grube
book...I have read the three chapters that were assigned, but I did not
know how you wanted the reading responses to be. Thanks.
