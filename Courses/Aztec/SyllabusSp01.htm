<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#FF0000">Course Description</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><font color="#FF9900">The Aztec, or Aztlaneca Mexica,
took to capturing and collecting the art and culture of all those domains
that they conquered and subjugated. As a result, Aztec art, thought and
culture reflect an eclectic mixture of the many peoples and cultures of
the empire. This course will explore the origins, art, language, and culture
of a Mesoamerican civilization that was unique for its emphasis on human
heart excision, but exclusively Mesoamerican in its art, architecture,
and ideology.</font>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#FF0000">Learning Outcomes
<hr WIDTH="100%"></font></b><font color="#FF9900">This ULR has not yet
been formally approved.&nbsp; As such, we will address this requirement
in anticipation of approval by terms end.&nbsp; Of course, in order to
fully address the Creative/Artistic Expression ULR, the following guidelines
will need to be met by way of your final project.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">Creative/Artistic Expression</font></b></center>

<p><font color="#FF9900"><b>Requirements:</b> Each student must produce
a work of art that communicates to a diverse audience.</font>
<p><font color="#FF9900"><b>What does this mean?</b>&nbsp; The emphasis
here is on moving the student to produce art through written, visual, or
performance that communicates to a diverse audience. In order to fulfill
this outcome, the student will need, through their own work, to demonstrate:</font>
<p><font color="#FF9900">&middot; That he or she -- through written, visual,
or performance -- comprehends the significance and expression of culture
in a variety of ways,</font>
<p><font color="#FF9900">&middot; That he or she successfully communicates
through the Arts by: Identifying the nature of the audience, knows that
he or she has something to say that links to the interests and needs of
that audience, understands the forms of communication specific to that
audience.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF9900">SBSC Major Learning Outcomes</font></b></center>

<p><font color="#FF9900">This course addresses the <b>MLO 1</b> (Theory)
and <b>3</b> (Applied) areas of the SBSC Major Learning Outcomes.&nbsp;
If you are taking this course in order to satisfy the second semester requirement
for the SBSC core course, your reading list will be supplemented for that
purpose, and you will be required to submit an annotated bibliography of
those readings completed in this section for the purposes of preparing
for the development of the final annotated bibliography due for your capstone
project.&nbsp; If you are not an SBSC major, or do not wish to have this
course count toward your capstone requirements, please notify your professor.</font>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#FF0000">Assessment/Grades</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><font color="#FF9900">It should be noted that the basis
of grading and assessment may be subject to slight variation from what
is noted below in the event that the class shifts its emphasis for the
purposes of study options and projects undertaken.&nbsp; Any changes will
be subject to class discussion and consensus where appropriate.</font>
<p><font color="#FF9900"><b>Participation:</b> Because this course will require 
  your in-class participation in discussion, lab exercises such as that of the 
  codex translation, and use of the online journal, 15 % of your final grade will 
  be assessed by way of your attendance and participation.&nbsp; Participation 
  will in part be assessed by way of the timely and thorough completion of online 
  journal entries completed on a weekly basis.&nbsp; Because many of these journal 
  entries will be completed during class time, and will address class participation 
  and lab exercises, it is critical that your participation be reflected in the 
  online journal.</font> 
<p><font color="#FF9900"><strong>Reader Response Papers:</strong> Approximately 
  ten one-page reader response papers will be completed by you and either entered 
  into the online journal or submitted in hardcopy as double-spaced narratives 
  that provide sufficient detail so that the instructor can assess your thorough 
  completion and understanding of the readings.&nbsp; The reader response papers 
  will account for approximately 30 % of your total grade.&nbsp; The reader response 
  papers will be graded at three percentage points per one-page essay if they 
  demonstrate your thorough understanding and reflection of the readings.&nbsp; 
  Two points will be given if a partial understanding of the readings are reflected, 
  and one percentage point will be offered if the essay was completed but did 
  not reflect a clear understanding of the readings assigned.</font> 
<p><font color="#FF9900"><b>Midterm and End Term Reviews:&nbsp;</b> A brief
take-home midterm review will be assigned on the basis of questions drawn
from lecture, discussion, readings and in-class labs completed to that
point in the semester.&nbsp; An End term review paper will cover that material
completed in that period extending from the Midterm review to the end of
the semester.&nbsp; The Midterm review is worth 15% points, and the final
is worth an additional 20% points.</font>
<p><font color="#FF9900"><b>Final Project and Oral Narrative:</b> So that
we can address the requirements of the Creative/Artistic Expression ULR,
your final project may take any number of different forms.&nbsp; You may
submit a final project paper (of no less than 10 typewritten double-spaced
pages) or you may create and post an Aztec website with content based on
your own research from reliable sources.&nbsp; In addition, for those that
wish to draw on Aztec poetry, art forms, or dance for their final projects,
the presentation of these final projects may be negotiated with your professor.&nbsp;
The final project is worth 20% of your grade.&nbsp; Please note that you
each have a possible total score of 100% or points possible.</font>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b><font color="#FF0000">Challenge Project Option 
<hr WIDTH="100%">
</font></b><font color="#FF9900">Because of the controversial nature surrounding 
the question of Aztec human sacrifice I have decided to opt for a final project 
offering that would pit you against the world of Aztec scholarship.&nbsp; If you 
would like to address either the question of (a) Aztec human sacrifice, or (b) 
Aztec militarism and empire building, you may do so with a thoroughly researched 
paper challenging the notion of either Aztec human sacrifice or warfare and empire.&nbsp; 
In order to begin this effort you would need to draw from works such as that of 
David Carrasco’s “City of Sacrifice” and other reputable sources.&nbsp; If your 
effort is to challenge the existence of human sacrifice, you may draw on both 
traditional and non-traditional scholarly and non-scholarly resources.&nbsp; You 
are cautioned however to provide sufficient evidence so as to weigh the evidence 
both for and against your position.&nbsp; By taking on this project you will be 
allowed the option of foregoing, or not being required to complete, the Midterm 
and Endterm Reviews or Examinations.&nbsp; No Incomplete grades or assignments 
will be permitted in this instance.</font> 
<p><font color="#FF9900"><strong>Patolli Game Competition:</strong> Patolli is 
  an ancient Mesoamerican &quot;board&quot; game that will be introduced after 
  midterm as a class competition. Competitors will target extra credit during 
  the course of the competitions to be announced.</font></p>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#FF0000">Classroom Expectations</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<font color="#FF9900">Please note that I will not accommodate any Incomplete grades, 
except by written medical excuse, and you are expected to submit your work on 
time.&nbsp; Because I will take attendance from time to time, and your participation 
in labs is required, please note that your attendance will not be counted if you 
are more than 10 minutes late to class.&nbsp; Where your professor’s attendance 
is concerned, I will notify the class in advance of any days that might require 
my absence; except in the case of an unforeseen illness.&nbsp; In those instances 
where I may be late to class, I will notify one student by telephone on the morning 
in which the late showing might be necessitated.&nbsp; Otherwise, please do not 
hesitate to contact me by email at ruben_mendoza@csumb.edu or by phone at 831-582-3760.</font> 
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b><font color="#FF0000">Office Hours:</font></b><font color="#FF9900"> My office 
hours for the Spring 2004 term will occur on Tuesdays between 1:00 pm and 3:00 
pm in Building 17, Room 117. Because I will also conduct some office hours from 
the Building 58 Archaeology Lab, please schedule any and all appointments in advance 
so that I can confirm locations..&nbsp; If you need other hours or options for 
meeting with the instructor, these will be by prior arrangement.</font>
