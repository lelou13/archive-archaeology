<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#CC0000">Playing the Game
<hr WIDTH="100%"></font></b><font color="#000000">The ancient Mexica Aztec
game of "patolli" has ancient roots extending into the Classic period of
Mesoamerican history and civilization (ca. AD 250-900).&nbsp; The Mexica
version of this game consisted of a cruciform pattern like that illustrated
with individual units representing the playing area.&nbsp; The game pieces
were entered by each of either two or four players as the result of the
toss of five dimpled beans or dice-like stones.&nbsp; In order to enter
the game, the participant must land a number one (as in one bean of five
with a single dot on its face) during the "dice" throw".&nbsp; Once entered,
the player advances in a clockwise direction around the board from the
point of entry...which lies within one of the four squares located at the
juncture of the cruciform pattern.&nbsp; The player then tosses the "dice"
and the number of spaces that the player is permitted to advance is dependent
on the total number that results from the toss.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The appearance of a "one" both allows the player
to enter another "chip" or bean into the game, or to advance a single space.&nbsp;
The numbers one through four are obtained by obtaining from one to four
numbered beans, whereas five beans or "dice" with a single number on its
face is equivalent to the number ten, as in ten spaces of the game board.&nbsp;
The objective of the game is to land on the last space of the game board
(or that space that immediately precedes the square within which the game
was begun by the affected player).&nbsp; The board contains 16 individual
squares that will assure the loss of one's "assets" and these consist of
those squares that contain the colored triangular patterns located at the
mid-point of each arm of the cruciform game board.&nbsp; If the player
lands a "bean" on any of these triangular shapes, the player forfeits to
his opponent two game pieces of the total of six game pieces awarded each
player at the start of the game.&nbsp; Landing in any of the semi-circular
units at the ends of each arm of the game board results in the opposing
player being forced to forfeit at least one "asset" to the player who scores
the end units on the game board.&nbsp; The player in question is also permitted
a second throw of the "dice" or beans for additional moves across the board.&nbsp;
Landing in any of the squares within the "cross-roads" area of the board
can result in losses if the opposing player happens to throw a number that
results in that player landing on the opposing player.&nbsp; The player
caught at the crossroads is forced to relinquish that game piece to the
opposing player.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The ultimate objective is to move all of your
game pieces onto and off of the board before your opponent does, and to
do so with a larger number of "assets" remaining in your possession.</font>
