<b><font color="#FFCC33">You may e-mail your questions and
requests for advising via the student e-mail accounts available to you.
The "SBSC Classes" (SBSD 248/348) folder serves as a forum for depositing
on-line assignments, and the SBSC Peer Counselors are available at Building
17 for your assistance.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFCC33">Important Notice: When submitting deliverables
and other assignments via the internet, please provide a clear and complete
identification label for your submissions. For example: Joan Doe, who is
registered in the lower division portion of the Spring 1998 Maya class,
and who is submitting Major Deliverable 2, would title her e-mail submission
and attachment as follows: sbsc248.doe.F98.md2 (upper or lower case letters
are acceptable).
<i>Any </i>assignment <i>that </i>does <i>not </i>contain
<i>the
</i>title
<i>format
</i>in <i>question </i>will <i>not </i>be <i>accepted
</i>for <i>evaluation</i>.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFCC33">All electronic submissions should be dropped
into the "Class Folder" specific to the section within which you are enrolled:
i.e., SBSC 248 submissions should be dropped in the SBSC 248 Classes Folder,
whereas SBSC 348 students will submit their assignments in the SBSC 348
Classes Folder.</font></b><b><font color="#FFCC33"></font></b>
