<B>Description:</B> Using the attached illustrations of Maya monuments with
Long Count inscriptions, please approximate the dating of each monument
by way of the simple calculation of the passage of days from the date of
August 13, 3114 B.C. I am looking only for an approximation to within a
year or so of the actual date.</FONT></P>

1. First, you will need to break into your previously assigned glyph groups.
Having come to gether within your specific group, you should again delegate
tasks as per the following tasks: (a) identification of glyphs, (b) interpretion
of position and meaning, (c) calculation of the specific number of days
represented, (d) calculation of the total number of days elapsed since August
13, 3114 B.C.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. You will need to begin interpretations only
on those monuments and those portions of monuments wherein there exists
the Initial Series Glyph (ISG) which consists of an oval-shaped cartouche
turned on end (like a cushion) within which are located two vertical box-like
lines and the image of an animal head out of the top of which sprouts a
serpent or serpentine-like horizontal bar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. Remember that you will generally be working
from the Initial Series Glyph downward from left to right (column to row),
left to right and so forth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Bear in mind that (a) a shell symbol [ ] is
the equivalent of the number zero, (b) a dot is equivalent to the number
one, and (c) a bar is the equivalent of the number five. Similarly, anytime
that you see a human or animal head with the likeness of a fleshless human
mandible, the mandible is equivalent to the number ten.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. The periods that you will need to interpret
are as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 <B>baktun</B> = 144,000 days or 20 katuns (Maya
Great Cycle @ 394.24 years)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 <B>katun</B> = 7,200 days or 20 tuns (Maya generation
or cycle @ 19.71 years)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 <B>tun</B> = 360 days or 18 uinals (Maya year)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 <B>uinal</B> = 20 days or 20 kins (Maya month)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 <B>kin</B> = 1 day (Maya solar day)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6. Upon completing with the calculation of the
Long Count date, please confirm the date with your professor's Maya calendar
calculation program. Then calculate and compare your results with the actual
day and year date provided by the computer generated program. The group
that comes closest to the actual date on their respective monument wins
the day's contest.</FONT></P>
