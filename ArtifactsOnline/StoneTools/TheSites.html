<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#CC0000">Phase Three: Interpreting the
Activity Areas</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Perhaps the most difficult aspect of any archaeological undertaking
is the interpretation of the many and varied forms of data that result
from such research.&nbsp; Having sampled the debris matrix created for
this purpose, you are now in a position to interpret the results of the
data that you have collected.
<p>Tabled data should provide some indication of the nature and extent
of the original activities undertaken at the sites sampled.&nbsp; The relative
size of the materials, particularly the length of flake tools and debitage
produced, should provide indications of the type of core reduction activities
that took place at the site or sites sampled.
<p>The photo above serves to document both the extent of the debitage and
tools produced, and similarly provides evidence of the tools themselves.&nbsp;
Tools include two antler tine flaking tools, and a horn hammer.&nbsp; In
addition, we see a small hammer stone in Unit "T12" in the upper left.
<p>Can you identify the sort of "flintknapping" activity that took place
at this site?&nbsp; Can you identify those areas within the photograph
that provide evidence for pressure flaking versus percussion flaking?&nbsp;
What debris is associated with pressure flaking?
