<p>Here at the Institute of Archaeology, we are working to scan the better
part of the archaeological collection of Old Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp;
Our goal is to create an image database of any and all archaeologically-recovered
materials from said site.&nbsp; Once posted, the database will serve as
a resource for scholars and students studying the material culture of the
California missions.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> You may click on any of the above
four images to view a "JPEG" version of the size and content of each image
scan required of any and all artifacts entered into the image database.&nbsp;
Artifact has been identified as a "Purple Transfer-print on white slip
earthenware shard."

<p><b>Precautionary Note: </b>Given that flatbed scanners were not originally
intended to scan objects in the round...or for that matter, objects with
the dust and grime of centuries, it is important to remember that the scanning
of artifacts must be done with great care so as to insure that one's scanner
is not damaged.&nbsp; As such, you should take care to avoid allowing the
accumulation of dust on the glass scanning bed.&nbsp; Carefully remove
any and all dust at regular intervals so as to avoid damage to the scanning
surface.&nbsp; In addition, you should wear cotton gloves so as to avoid
leaving finger prints (and their attendant oils) on the scanning surface.&nbsp;
While not injurious to the scanning surface, the fingerprints will appear
in final scanned images if you are not careful.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Use the following alphanumeric (letter
and number-based) format for labeling scanned PSD’s and JPG’s: sjb00819-00-1
(where sjb = San Juan Bautista; 00819 = main catalog number of five digits;
00 = the secondary catalog number count; and the 1 represents the scan
number for both the Photoshop Document file (.psd) and the Jpeg (.jpg)
files.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Where possible, the artifact background
should be black (in the case of light or white colored artifacts), and
white (in the case of very dark or black colored artifacts).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Scanner settings on the Agfa Duoscan
T-1200 or T-2400 are as follows:&nbsp; Initial scan (with metric measure
included) should be done at 150 pixels/inch, as a Reflective scan, in RGB
color, at 100%.&nbsp; Width of final image should be set at 4.0 inches,
height at 4.0 (or 3.795 inches), at a resolution of 72 pixels/inch.&nbsp;
File size at this rate is about 231K.&nbsp; Initial image should be a PSD
file, and the second image should be a Jpeg file (at high quality or at
a setting of 6).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Initial scan with metric measure should
include all 10 centimeters of the metric measure placed just below the
artifacts being scanned.&nbsp; You should place the artifact(s) at the
center of a 10 cm. X 10 cm. Frame (ca. 4” x 4”).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Where artifacts, such as porcelains
or other ceramics, include patterns, designs, or other distinctive features,
scans should be done of each side of the artifact.&nbsp; The same main/secondary
catalog number should be retained for the other side of the artifact, but
the final digit, included after the catalog number proper, will change
one increment (e.g., sjb00819-00-2 to sjb00819-00-3).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; In the cropped scan of the artifact,
without the metric measure, the number will change similarly (e.g., sjb00819-00-1
to sjb00819-00-2).&nbsp; In addition, the scan settings (Photoshop) for
the artifact without the metric measure will be as follows: width = 2 inches;
height = 2 inches; resolution = 150 pixels/inch.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; In sum, if the artifact being scanned
has distinctive features on both its top and&nbsp; bottom face, then you
should produce the following scans of said artifact at the settings noted
above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Top
of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact in PSD (Photoshop)
format for archive,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Top
of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact in JPEG format
for posting to Internet,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Top
of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any rectangular
crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved in PSD format,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; Top
of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any rectangular
crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved in JPEG format,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; Bottom
side of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact in PSD (Photoshop)
format for archive,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp; Bottom
of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact in JPEG format
for posting to Internet,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; Bottom
of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any rectangular
crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved in PSD format,
and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h)&nbsp; Bottom
of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any rectangular
crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved in JPEG format.&nbsp;
In this instance, you should have eight scanned images (four in PSD format
and four in JPEG format).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; All images scanned on a particular
day should be saved in a desktop folder (or on Zip disk) with the Folder
titled in the following format: “sjbArtifacts8-25-99” (where sjb = San
Juan Bautista, Artifacts = subject, and 8-25-99 = date of scanning).
