<br>Here at the Institute of Archaeology, we are working to scan the better
part of the archaeological collection of Old Mission San Juan Bautista.&nbsp;
Our goal is to create an image database of any and all archaeologically-recovered
materials from said site.&nbsp; Once posted, the database will serve as
a resource for scholars and students studying the material culture of the
California missions.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Precautionary Note:</b> Given that flatbed scanners were not originally
intended to scan objects in the round...or for that matter, objects with
the dust and grime of centuries, it is important to remember that the scanning
of artifacts must be done with great care so as to insure that one's scanner
is not damaged.&nbsp; As such, you should take care to avoid allowing the
accumulation of dust on the glass scanning bed.&nbsp; Carefully remove
any and all dust at regular intervals so as to avoid damage to the scanning
surface.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, you should wear cotton gloves so as
to avoid leaving finger prints (and their attendant oils) on the scanning
surface.&nbsp; While not injurious to the scanning surface, the fingerprints
will appear in final scanned images if you are not careful.
<p>1. Use the following alphanumeric (letter and number-based) format for
labeling scanned PSD’s and JPG’s: <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>sjb00819-00-1</font></font>
(where sjb = San Juan Bautista; 00819 = main catalog number of five digits;
00 = the secondary catalog number count; and the 1 represents the scan
number for both the Photoshop Document file (.psd) and the Jpeg (.jpg)
files.
<p>2. Where possible, the <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>artifact
background should be black</font></font> (in the case of light or white
colored artifacts), and white (in the case of very dark or black colored
artifacts).
<p>3. Scanner settings on the Agfa Duoscan T-1200 or T-2400 are as follows:&nbsp;
Initial scan (with metric measure included) should be done at <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>150
pixels/inch</font></font>, as a Reflective scan, in RGB color, at 100%.&nbsp;
Width of final image should be set at 4.0 inches, height at 4.0 (or 3.795
inches), at a resolution of <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>72 pixels/inch</font></font>.&nbsp;
File size at this rate is about 231K.&nbsp; Initial image should be a PSD
file, and the second image should be a Jpeg file (at high quality or at
a setting of 6).
<p>4. Initial scan with metric measure should include all 10 centimeters
of the metric measure placed just below the artifacts being scanned.&nbsp;
You should place the artifact(s) at the center of a 10 cm. X 10 cm. Frame
(ca. 4” x 4”).
<p>5. Where artifacts, such as porcelains or other ceramics, include patterns,
designs, or other distinctive features, scans should be done of each side
of the artifact.&nbsp; The same main/secondary catalog number should be
retained for the other side of the artifact, but the final digit, included
after the catalog number proper, will change one increment (e.g., sjb00819-00-2
to sjb00819-00-3).
<p>6. In the cropped scan of the artifact, without the metric measure,
the number will change similarly (e.g., sjb00819-00-1 to sjb00819-00-2).&nbsp;
In addition, the scan settings (Photoshop) for the artifact without the
metric measure will be as follows: <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>width
= 2 inches; height = 2 inches; resolution = 150 pixels/inch.</font></font>
<p>7. In sum, if the artifact being scanned has distinctive features on
both its top and&nbsp; bottom face, then you should produce the following
scans of said artifact at the settings noted above.
(a) Top of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact
in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>PSD</font></font> (Photoshop) format
for archive,
<p>(b) Top of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>JPEG
</font></font>format
for posting to Internet,
<p>(c) Top of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any rectangular
crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>PSD</font></font>
format,
<p>(d) Top of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any rectangular
crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>JPEG</font></font>
format,
<p>(e) Bottom side of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact
in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>PSD</font></font> (Photoshop) format
for archive,
<p>(f) Bottom of artifact with 10 cm scale at bottom edge of artifact in
<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>JPEG</font></font>
format for posting to Internet,
<p>(g) Bottom of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any
rectangular crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved
in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>PSD</font></font> format, and
<p>(h) Bottom of artifact without 10 cm scale cropped to artifact in any
rectangular crop that fully incorporates the body of the artifact saved
in <font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>JPEG</font></font> format.&nbsp;
In this instance, you should have eight scanned images (four in PSD format
and four in JPEG format).</blockquote>

<p><br>8. All images scanned on a particular day should be saved in a desktop
folder (or on Zip disk) with the Folder titled in the following format:
<font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>“sjbArtifacts8-25-99”
</font></font>(where
sjb = San Juan Bautista, Artifacts = subject, and 8-25-99 = date of scanning).
