of the CSU Monterey Bay Institute of Archaeology is both an archaeologist
and photographer.&nbsp; To date, Professor Mendoza has published many examples
of his photography in both academic and popular publications ranging from
technical articles to magazines, anthologies to encyclopedias; and has,
in addition, exhibited his photography at the University of Arizona, Tucson;
as well as for the Loveland Gallery, and the Denver sites of the EPA (Environmental
Protection Agency) and Mexican Consulates of Colorado; the Mexican Heritage
Plaza of San Jose, California; and at several locations on the California
State University Monterey Bay campus.&nbsp; If you would like to see examples
of Professor Mendoza's work, please check this link from time to time for
exhibition venues and related information.&nbsp; Recent exhibitions include
the following:</font>

<p>Twenty-one color prints from medium format transparencies printed in
16" x 20" and 20" x 30" formats.&nbsp; Includes detailed captions pertaining
to the art and architecture of the early Hispanic colonial mission of San
Juan Bautista, Alta California.&nbsp; This exhibition was sponsored by
the California Missions Foundation and the CSU Monterey Bay Institute of
Archaeology.&nbsp; A full color mailer and black and white exhibition catalog

The exhibition is being featured in the Community Theater Lobby of the
Mexican Heritage Plaza located at 1700 Alum Rock Avenue in San Jose, California.&nbsp;
For further information, contact Laura Esparza, the Director of Programs
at the Mexican Heritage Corporation.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.mhcviva.org/">http://www.mhcviva.org/</a>
for further information on the Plaza; and <a href="http://www.mhcviva.org/directions.html">http://www.mhcviva.org/directions.html</a>
for further information on its location.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because I am planning on moving the exhibition to a new venue after the
run at the Mexican Heritage Plaza, if your institution is interested in
hosting the exhibition, please contact me at your earliest convenience
at the voice mail address noted below.
