Ruben Mendoza and his students first undertook, and completed within six
weeks, the development of an instructional CD-ROM aimed at illuminating
the archaeology, art, and history of the Old Mission and community of San
Juan Bautista, California.&nbsp; Because Dr. Mendoza's archaeological and
ethnohistorical research in said community began in the summer of 1995,
Dr. Mendoza has amassed thousands of photographic images of the community,
including events ranging from the yearly Fiesta to the Old Mission's bicentennial
celebration.&nbsp; And that in addition to the many images devoted to documenting
the archaeological and historical investigations completed thus far.&nbsp;
In addition, because his excavations and museum education project efforts
-- spanning the past five years -- have been recorded on S-VHS tape, as
well as in digital media, audio, hardcopy documents, and electronic maps,
it was time to convert a small fraction of that media to a medium that
would benefit the community and its many visitors.</font></td>

<td><font color="#000000">In the Spring of 2000, Dr. Mendoza submitted
a research proposal to the CSU Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity
Awards Competition at CSU Monterey Bay.&nbsp; As a result of his submission
-- titled "Archaeology, Multimedia and Online Resources for Old Mission
San Juan Bautista" -- Dr. Mendoza was awarded $5,000.00 to undertake the
hiring of six student assistants to produce an instructional courseware
project intended to support Professor Mendoza's many teaching and research-related
endeavors.&nbsp; Because little time or resources were available for some
of the preliminary planning and expertise necessary for the undertaking
in question, the assembled team found innovative solutions and undertook
a considerable amount of problem-solving to bring the product to fruition.&nbsp;
Some of the challenges and innovations undertaken will be documented in
future installments on this portion of the site.</font></td>
