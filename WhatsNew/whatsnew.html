<td>Renee Cannon, a CSU Monterey Bay Social and Behavioral Sciences major
in archaeology, presented the results of her research before the <a href="announcements/CSUstudentResearch01.html">15th
Annual CSU Student Research Competition</a> that took place on April 27,
2001, in San Jose, California.&nbsp; Renee's paper, titled "Material Culture
Change at the Neophyte Housing Area, Mission San Juan Bautista," was presented
in Session 2 of the Behavioral and Social Sciences undergraduate portion
of the conference.&nbsp; Her presentation was accompanied by a Powerpoint
overview of her findings which were reported in her 80 page senior capstone
report based on her compilation and analysis of some 4300 artifacts excavated
from the Neophyte Housing Area of Old San Juan.&nbsp; It should be noted
that Renee worked closely with state archaeologist Glenn Farris (who re-excavated
the area in 1991), and Renee commuted regularly to the Sacramento area
to study and quantify every specimen of the collection for her research.&nbsp;
The results of Renee's research are now scheduled for publication by the
CSUMB Institute of Archaeology for the Fall of 2001.&nbsp;</td>

Mendoza.&nbsp; The article, titled "The Virtual Learning Lab: Facilitated
Teaching and Learning in the Online Environment," was published in the
volume <u>Emerging Technologies in Teaching Languages and Cultures: Effective
Use of Technology for Language Learning: What Works and What We've Learned</u>,
edited by Yoshiko Saito-Abbott, Richard Donovan, Thomas F. Abbott, and
Phillip Kennedy (LARC Press, San Diego, California).&nbsp; The article
details the online curriculum, technology, software and hardware applications,
and other salient features of the Institute's transition to online and
distributed learning modes of teaching archaeology and art history.&nbsp;
In addition, Dr. Mendoza detailed the Institute's "Ancient Technologies
and Cultures Projects Lab" used to instruct students in ancient technologies,
flintknapping, and database applications in archaeology.&nbsp; Contact

Mendoza, who serves in a curatorial capacity for the Old Mission, and as
the principal investigator for the Old Mission's archaeological program,
submitted the grant proposal on February 17th of 2001.&nbsp; The proposal,
titled <u>A Proposed Conservation Treatment for the Santos of the Main
