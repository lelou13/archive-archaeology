completed the creation of a coloring book for Old Mission San Juan Bautista.
The coloring book, with an initial print run of 200, proved itself a real
success at the recent Museum Education Project Open House held on May 8,
1999. Arrangements have been made with the California Department of Corrections
(Soledad facility) to have 3,000 copies printed for distribution at upcoming
events. The coloring book details the history and culture of the Old Mission
from the perspective of a Native American (Mutsune) child.&nbsp; As of
September, 1999, the coloring book was being printed (complete with a color-print
cover), and is scheduled for release in October, 1999.&nbsp; Return to

button and enter the “Sample” database. Professor Mendoza’s students will
be provided password-protected access to the database for the purpose of
class study and capstone research. This database is the result of much
work and planning by the crews of the Alta California Mission Research
Project. A recent grant of $5,000 from the CSU Research Awards Competition
made to Professor Mendoza will allow for the completion of the data entry
portion of this project. Justin Evans, CSUMB archaeology/multimedia graduate
student and SBSC student technician, helped launch the project effort with
the posting and redesign of an artifact database developed by Professor
Mendoza. Please feel free to revisit this page for additional updates and
instructional modules that will make use of the database materials and
