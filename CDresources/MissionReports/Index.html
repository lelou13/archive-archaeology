<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>While much of the documents collection of Old Mission San Juan Bautista
has been dispersed or lost as the result of deterioration, mishandling,
and removal or sale by collectors, there remains a significant collection
of early documents and photographs in the archives of the Old Mission.&nbsp;
While the Old Mission's manuscript collection consists of 17th through
early 20th century books and papers, and a few early handwritten letters
and notes, much of the original early document collection now resides at
the Santa Barbara Mission Archive, the Bancroft Library, and in a variety
of other public and private repositories and collections.&nbsp; For those
using the CD-ROM, this section is intended to provide a password-protected
online repository for those interested in reviewing transcriptions of early
documents and copies of digitized versions of those documents available
to this project.&nbsp; Please return to this portion of the CD-ROM's linked
collections of resources for future installments and additions to the historic
resources section.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><font color="#000000">The "Ynformes" or "Informes" represent the annual
reports made by the early Franciscan missionaries of Old Mission San Juan
Bautista.&nbsp; These reports span the years from 1797 through 1840, and
represent the annual accounting related to population figures (birthm marriage,
and mortality), religious and civil ceremonial activity, agricultural activity
and productivity, construction activity, and both episodes of prosperity
and decline.</font>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><font color="#000000">The facsimiles or digital versions of early documents
found at this site are intended for your perusal.&nbsp; While most of the
earliest documents are written entirely in Spanish, and as such, should
prove beneficial to those who read the Spanish language, the often cryptic
and very elaborate style of writing used in these early documents may prove
more than most can handle for the purposes of interpretation or transcription.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the document samples provided here should enlighten the CD-ROM
user to the wealth of information and documentary evidence that remains
largely undeciphered or unstudied in many an historical repository.</font>
