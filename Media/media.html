on either of the two images noted above for an object-oriented Quicktime
Virtual Reality (QTVR) movie.&nbsp; The above two images represent artifacts
in the collection of Professor Ruben Mendoza.&nbsp; Each QTVR image was
produced with the Kaidan object rig, and on the one hand, the Olympus digital
camera (Moche.mov), and the Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera (Virgin.mov)
on the other.&nbsp; Charlie Wallace, a CSUMB multimedia technician and
Dr. Mendoza collaborated on the production of the images; whereas Charlie
Wallace edited the images and used the Quicktime VR Editing Suite to stitch
the edited images into the format included here.
<p>The CSUMB Institute of Archaeology is now fully equiped to produce both
object images, as well as 360-degree landscape panoramas, for the virtual
museum and online instructional media development projects currently underway
at Old Mission San Juan Bautista.
<p><b>Note:</b> If you do not already have the QTVR plugin/player loaded
on your computer, you may need to download the player so as to view the
images as they were intended to be seen.&nbsp; Each image may be rotated
a full 360 degrees with the click of your cursor.&nbsp; In order to download
the player, click on the QTVR icon located just below the images above.

<hr WIDTH="100%">QuickTime VR is a 3D virtual reality or panoramic image
authoring and stitching program created by the folks at Apple computing.
We have assembled several samples of the type of work that we are producing
for the Old Mission project. In addition to QTVR panoramas that will allow
you to view a 360 degree image of the rooms at the Old Mission, you will
also see examples of QTVR object images that allow you to completely rotate
objects (such as statuary and models) a full 360 degrees.
<p>This feature will require that your computer currently have the QTVR
player installed on your hard drive. If you do not have the player, please
feel free to download the player by clicking the QTVR plug-in button included
just below the QTVR samples on this page.

CSUMB, or those who have been provided with password access, this portion
of the Web site provides a wealth of images authored by Professor Mendoza
related to archaeology, art history, Hispanic material culture, museum
conservation, technical imaging, and ASTV projects currently underway.
In addition, Professor Mendoza’s extensive collection of world archaeology
images (largely focused on Mesoamerica, Central America, and the Southwestern
US) is available for review by way of a password-protected link.
<p>If you would like access to the image database, and are not currently
a student of the ASTV, please feel free to complete the registration form
located at this link. For those wishing access to high resolution TIFF
or JPEG images, please contact Professor Mendoza at <a href="mailto:ruben_mendoza@csumb.edu">ruben_mendoza@csumb.edu</a>

was taken with a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera as part of an 1800 acre
archaeological survey of the Caribou Ranch portion of the Indian Peaks
Wilderness area of Colorado conducted in August, 1999.&nbsp; As the result
of a one week period on the pedestrian survey, Dr. Mendoza produced some
300 such digital images of the project area and its archaeological and
historical remains.&nbsp; Dr. Charles Cambridge (Navajo/Dene) is lead archaeologist
and owner of Medicine Bow Consultants of Boulder, Colorado, one of the
few, if not the only, Native American-owned archaeological firms in the

<p>The audio notes portion of this site provides a low tech answer for
those wishing to obtain an overview of project developments at Old Mission
San Juan Bautista. In addition, this portion of the site will entail audio
summaries of lectures concerned with the many and varied aspects of archaeology
in the Information Age.
<p>In order to use the audio notes portion of this site, you will need
to be sure that you have an adequate set of speakers for your computer,
and a Wave, MIDI, or Real Audio Player plug-in setup on your computer.
If you do not have any one of these formats, you may download the player
below. Please note that because this portion of the Web site is currently
under development, not all audio clips have been recorded in all three
formats noted.

<p>The Project Video portion of this Web site is intended to provide a
video summary of some aspects of the archaeology, oral history, and museum
education portions of the project currently underway at Old Mission San
Juan Bautista. In addition, we have included video clips from video and
documentary projects currently under development through the efforts of
the ASTV. Again, it may be necessary to download the Quicktime video player
plug-in (linked to the blue Quicktime player logo at the top of this page)
in order to view the video clips included within this portion of the site.
<p>In this instance, the video clip was created with a Sony digital video
camera during a visit by Professor Mendoza to the National Museum of African
Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.&nbsp; The video clip presents
a walk-around video segment of one of the many bronze portrait heads of
the Benin peoples and civilizations of West Africa.&nbsp; The portrait
head very likely represents an Oba, or Benin spiritual leader, of the 17th
Century.&nbsp; Learn more about pre-Colonial African Civilizations by going
