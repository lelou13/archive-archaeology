<br><b>SBS<font color="#CC0000">D</font> 248: Ancient Maya Civilization</b>
<br>4 credits
<p>An exploration of the spectacular archaeological, epigraphic, and historical
discoveries that have revolutionized emerging perspectives on the culture
and civilization of the ancient Maya of southern Mexico and Central America.
Classic Maya civilization, which has traditionally been dated to between
A.D. 250 and 900, has been found to have evolved far earlier, and persisted
far longer than once thought. Epigraphic or Mayan glyphic studies and research
currently underway in the Maya heartland clearly attest to the antiquity
and richness of a culture and civilization that evolved and endured in
the Mesoamerican tropics for nearly three thousand years. Course content
will draw upon an ever expanding world of &Ograve;virtual&Oacute; software-based
glyphic translation and astronomical and calendrical correlation programs
created for the purpose of probing directly into the rich literary, artistic,
and historical traditions of recently recovered ancient Maya texts and
monuments. This learning experience will examine the social, cultural,
economic, political, and religious underpinnings of the Maya dynastic tradition
in comparative and cross-cultural terms and from the perspective of landmark
archaeological projects and glyphic interpretations, and their respective
significance in deciphering the larger Maya lifeway. Dr. Ruben Mendoza
<p><b>SBS<font color="#CC0000">D</font> 269: Ancient Mesoamerica</b>
<br>4 credits
<p>This course provides a comparative survey of the social, ideological,
economic, and political formations and cultural dynamics of the major indigenous
pre-Hispanic centers of civilization in Mesoamerica. Special consideration
is given the technological, social-historical, and ideological foundations
of these cultural systems. The area under consideration spans the region
from Zacatecas, Mexico, to the Isthmus of Panama. Upper division credit

<br>4 credits
<p>An exploration of the rise and fall of the indigenous states and civilizations
of sub-Saharan Africa. While this course places emphasis on the rise of
civilization in precolonial or Black Africa, and to a lesser extent, Africa&Otilde;s
relations with Eurasia, this learning experience will review the comparative
development and contributions of those ancient cultures and civilizations
of sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean. Ancient cultures, kingdoms
and states including those of dynastic Egypt, Kush, Axum, Jenne, Zimbabwe,
the Swahili complex, and Benin and West Africa serve as the primary case
studies for this exploration into the archaeology of complex societies.
The comparative approach of this learning experience will rely on materials
ranging from internet sites and CD-rom resources through readings, videos,
lectures and problem-oriented discussions and overviews that serve to frame
the rise of civilization in precolonial Africa. Upper division credit for
this course is available by registering for SBSC 380A. Prerequisite(s):

of the primary ancient states and civilizations of the Pacific Rim. Encompassing
that area identified as the Pacific Rim, including Asia and the Americas,
this learning experience will review the comparative development and contributions
of those ancient cultures and civilizations identified with regions as
diverse as Cambodia and Bolivia, and as complex as ancient China, Japan,
Peru and Mesoamerica. Because this learning experience is comparative in
scope, such ancient cultures, kingdoms and states as those represented
by the Jomon, Olmec, Zhou, Qin, Chaco, Moche, Maya, Ankor, Inca, Tokugawa,
and Aztec serve as the primary resources and case studies for this exploration
into the archaeology of complex societies. The comparative cultural complexity
and diversity of the ancient cultures and civilizations of the Pacific
Rim will be examined by way of course materials ranging from internet sites
and CD-rom resources through readings, videos, lectures andproblem-oriented
discussions and overviews that serve to frame the cultural and social evolution
of civilizational development on the Pacific Rim. Intended to serve as
the learning counterpart of SBSC 280A/380A: Lost Civilizations of Africa
and Eurasia. Upper division credit for this course is available by registering

Virtual Museum Design</b>
<br>2-4 credits
<p>This project-based learning experience provides a hands-on or workshop-based
approach to museum project development and design in a community setting.
Projects will vary from year to year, however, the primary intent of this
project lab is to promote the development of new community or local history
museums and living history programs on the Central Coast. This specific
workshop will work to place students in the role of collaborating in the
design and development of a campus-based community museum at Fort Ord,
California. Final project designs will be entered into a user-friendly
3D virtual rendering program and posted on the CSUMB Museum Education Project
web site. Designs selected for use will serve as the basis for the development
of the Fort Ord community museum. While this course requires only two contact
hours of class time per week, additional credit for documented lab or field
project efforts may be added for a total of four credit hours. Upper division
credit for this course is available by registering for SBSC 323sl. Prerequisite(s):
none. Dr. Ruben Mendoza

San Juan Mission Museum Education Project</b>
<br>4 credits
<p>This course is devoted to the creation of a museum education program
for the Old Mission of San Juan Bautista. Student projects will center
on the development of museum exhibitions, artifact displays, and multimedia
instructional materials and educational resources directed at the 1997
bicentennial celebrations of the Old Mission. While instruction and project
development will center on those methods and procedures entailed in the
hands-on creation of a public education program for the Old Mission of
San Juan Bautista, the broader learning experience of this project lab
will address museum education and docent programming, children&Otilde;s
multimedia, multicultural education, cultural resource management, and
information management in public contexts. Service Learning contributions
and community participation will be a mainstay of this learning experience,
and students from within the social sciences, the arts and humanities,
liberal studies, and teacher education are encouraged to participate in
this service learning practicum. Upper division credit for this course
is available by registering for SBSC 364 sl. Prerequisite(s): none. Dr.
