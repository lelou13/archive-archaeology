                                  Evaluation of Wireless Garbage Project Data 
                                  Entry: April 17, 2003: Excellent connectivity 
                                  and glitch-free data entry was the order of 
                                  the day. Sunny skies and cloud cover shortly 
                                  after storm. Only problems encountered were 
                                  with two students who accidently kicked themselves 
                                  into the Carmel Mission database. This has occured 
                                  previouly and will need to be corrected. April 
                                  10, 2003: We experienced a variety of connectivity 
                                  problems with both the Toshiba e740 and Compaq 
                                  iPaq 3950 units. Students repeatedly lost connections 
                                  with iPaq units, and e740 units less enhanced 
                                  wireless cards did not connect at all and were 
                                  not used. Due to this problem day I took the 
                                  step of ordering 5 additional wireless cards 
                                  for the Toshibas. One other issue with the e740's 
                                  is the darkness of the screen which slows data 
                                  entry somewhat. April 3, 2003: Good connectivity 
                                  and largely glitch-free data entry was the order 
                                  of the day. Sunny skies and some cloud cover. 
                                  Only problems encountered were with students 
                                  who accidently kicked themselves into the Carmel 
                                  Mission database. This has occured previouly 
                                  and will need to be corrected. Also, while both 
                                  Toshiba and Compaq units functioned reasonably 
                                  well, one of the iPaq units repeatedly lost 
                                  signal. Overall,I believe that the Wireless 
                                  Pocket PC's performed reasonably well and that 
                                  real-time wireless data management was a great 
                                  success.</p>

                                  This posting of a Wireless Journal entry is

                                  get the university to wire this building for 
                                  Internet communications, the archaeology program 
                                  and it's students have been unable to conduct

                                  As of today, it is apparent that at least as 
                                  far as the front entry area of Building 110 
                                  is concerned, we can in fact use the existing

                                  This is the second successful posting of a Wireless

                                  Lab. Because this building has not been rewired 
                                  for phone or Internet access we have had to 
                                  forego any sort of real-time data management 
                                  via the Internet from this location. Typically, 
                                  we have found it necessary to post individual 
                                  entries via a laptop database which would then 
                                  be backed up to diskette and then uploaded and 
                                  merged with the Institute for Archaeology (ASTV) 
                                  server-based database. Invariably, this has 
                                  resulted in the uneven conversion or upload 
                                  of the complete data set. Beginning next Tuesday, 
                                  April 29th, 2003, the SBSC 224s/324s flintknapping 
                                  or stone tools production lab will be conducted 
                                  from the Building 110 site and data and journal 
                                  entries will be posted in real-time by students 
                                  participating in said project. Whereas we were 
                                  previously unable to get the university to sponsor 
                                  the wiring of this specific building (Building 
                                  110), it would appear that the proximity and 
                                  coverage of the wireless network at CSUMB will 
                                  now permit data entry from the foyer or porch 
                                  of this same building.</p>

                                  demonstrated the use of hard and soft hammer

                                  Index cards with each unit were prepared by

                                  students select unit numbers at random. Upon 
                                  completing the stone tool demonstration, which 
                                  required the better part of the period from 
                                  about 10:30 to 11:40 am, students were instructed 
                                  to return to Building 110 on Thursday, May 1st, 
                                  2003. Today, I gave students the opportunity 
                                  to produce flake tools by way of hard hammer 
                                  (cobble or pebble) and soft hammer (antler tine). 
                                  Each student was provided with a pair of leather 
                                  gloves, goggles, a leather pad, an antler tine, 
                                  and a cobble or pebble. Students soon discovered 
                                  how challenging it was to produce a useable 
                                  flake for retouch purposes. A number of messages 
                                  posted at this Wireless Journal site make note 
                                  of the difficulties encountered in the exercise. 
                                  As always, the fact that the group needed to 
                                  be broken up into two separate work spaces complicated 
                                  my ability to provide instruction to each in 
                                  a timely manner...particularly given the fact 
                                  that everyone was so anxious to get started 
                                  with the flintknapping experiment. I moved from 
                                  person to person correcting or instructing them 
                                  on the proper use of the antler tine or cobble 
                                  for percussion and or pressure flaking. Upon 
                                  the completion of their respective efforts to 
                                  produce a useable flake tool, I then had the 
                                  students select the numbered cards so as to 
                                  sample individual units. Each student group 
                                  of five persons then selected five individual 
                                  units for collection. Upon collecting the specimens 
                                  from the five units selected at random, students 
                                  were then instructed to follow protocol with 
                                  the sorting and counting of lithic debris based 
                                  on size categories (&lt; 1.0 cm; 1.0-2.0 cm; 
                                  etc.) and then the weighing of materials based 
                                  on those same categories. Upon having completed 
                                  this portion of the lab exercise, everyone was 
                                  instructed to post a Wireless Journal entry 
                                  about what they observed and experienced during 
                                  this week's lab exercise. Students used both 
                                  a Mac laptop and Toshiba e740 and Compaq iPaq 
                                  3950 Pocket PC's. I prepared the settings for 
                                  each of the PDA's and for the most part the 
                                  units all performed well. When one considers 
                                  that the Building 110 lab is not supposed to 
                                  be on the Wireless Network or any other telecommunications 
                                  grid, I am elated at the fact that the Building 
                                  110 lab is now able to connect to the Internet-based 
                                  datasets developed and posted on the Institute 
                                  for Archaeology data server. Gilbert Gonzales, 
                                  our campus CTO, has also noted that the transect 
                                  surveys and garbology surveys with Wireless 
                                  data transmissions should not have been possible 
                                  given the fact that the campus quad that we 
                                  have been using for wireless transmissions is 
                                  not technically wired for wireless use. Given 
                                  that fact, I can now reassess the effectiveness 
                                  of the Wireless Project's data management program 
                                  in light of the fact that we have managed to 
                                  accomplish the impossible...even if somewhat 
                                  imperfectly. My assessments of student impressions 
                                  of the wireless project will need to take this 
                                  latter fact into account. PS: This final Wireless

                                  Journal entries for the SBSC 224s/324s &quot;Flintknapping&quot; 
                                  or &#8220;Stone Tools&#8221; production lab 
                                  of Thursday, May 1st, 2003. This post was made 
                                  from a Mac Powerbook G4 laptop by wireless transmission 
                                  from the CSU Monterey Bay Building 110 Archaeology 
                                  Lab. Despite the fact that the Building 110 
                                  lab has no working telecommunications infrastructure 
                                  whatsoever, all Wireless Journal entries made 
                                  this day by students and myself to this portion 
                                  of the Wireless Technologies website and database 
                                  were made via wireless laptops and both Toshiba 
                                  e740 and Compaq iPaq 3950 Pocket PC's. It should 
                                  be noted that the Toshiba e740s worked extraordinarily 
                                  well. Prior use of the e740s from the CSU Monterey 
                                  Bay campus quad was somewhat unpredictable. 
                                  Given that we have since upgraded the wireless 
                                  cards on all five e740 units, and I have since 
                                  learned from campus CTO Gilbert Gonzales that 
                                  the campus quad is not &#8220;wired&#8221; for 
                                  wireless reception, I believe that we have achieved 
                                  considerable success given that all of the earlier 
                                  postings of wireless journals and data were 
                                  achieved in an environment deemed not to be 
                                  rigged for wireless telecommunications. Given 
                                  that fact, I will need to revisit student concerns 
                                  with the varied results that we achieved in 
                                  the campus quad areas. In addition, one other 
                                  finding from the project, and particularly the 
                                  Wireless Transect Surveys conducted in February, 
                                  is that many areas of the campus quad do in 
                                  fact have wireless connectivity, even if only 
                                  by default. We believe that the wireless connectivity 
                                  achieved in the quad areas was a byproduct of 
                                  a wireless bleed from existing wireless connectivity 
                                  previously thought to work only within those 
                                  buildings configured for wireless. In other 
                                  words, we should not have been able to connect 
                                  to the Internet or post Wireless Journals or 
                                  enter wireless Site Catalog Tool database entries 
                                  from the campus quad at CSU Monterey Bay. Even 
                                  so, Gilbert Gonzales and the IT team here at 
                                  CSU Monterey Bay are now looking into what needs 
                                  to be configured for wireless beyond those areas 
                                  on 6th street currently targeted for the installation 
                                  of wireless antennas purchased by my colleague 
                                  Dr. Yong Lao. On Tuesday, April 29th students 
                                  met in the Building 110 Archaeology Lab to participate 
                                  in a flintknapping demonstration conducted by 
                                  me for the purposes of preparing students for 
                                  their own participation in the lab exercise 
                                  in question. At that time I demonstrated the 
                                  effective use of hard and soft hammer percussion, 
                                  indirect percussion, and pressure flaking methods 
                                  for stone tool production. In the process of 
                                  demonstrating the varied techniques in question, 
                                  I also succeeded in creating a debris field 
                                  or lithic scatter that will be the subject of 
                                  ongoing analysis by students for the end term 
                                  project. The demonstration in question ran from 
                                  about 10:30 am to 11:40 am. Today, Thursday, 
                                  May 1, 2003, Wireless Project student assistant 
                                  Rob Lecel prepared two additional areas for 
                                  the flintknapping exercises. A gridded tarp, 
                                  like that used in past experiments, was anchored 
                                  with duct tape to the floor areas on the north 
                                  end of the building. The grid in question is 
                                  composed of 20 x 20 centimeter units configured 
                                  within an alphanumerically designed grid pattern. 
                                  The unit numbers as such span the range from 
                                  A1 through Q13. Students were assembled about 
                                  the main grid at the center of the lab and instructed 
                                  to obtain a pair of leather gloves, goggles, 
                                  a leather flintknapping pad, an antler tine, 
                                  and a cobble or pebble provided as part of the 
                                  flintknapping tool kit. Students were again 
                                  reminded of the importance of taking precautions 
                                  and following protocols closely to avoid mishaps. 
                                  In addition, I asked that students await my 
                                  specific instructions or other guidance. Students 
                                  were then provided with a chunk of obsidian 
                                  for the exercise. Students were given that period 
                                  from about 10:15 am to about 11:10 am to work 
                                  on perfecting their abilities to strike or create 
                                  a primary flake worthy of retouch or other modification. 
                                  After having added to the debris field or lithic 
                                  scatter, students were then asked to reconstitute 
                                  their respective groups and to select Unit numbers 
                                  from the bucket of index cards replete with 
                                  individual unit numbers. In this way students 
                                  were asked to select five individual units for 
                                  a random sampling of units from the area of 
                                  the gridded tarp constituting the debris field. 
                                  Having done this, students were then asked to 
                                  collect every piece of lithic debris contained 
                                  within those units selected by random sample. 
                                  Having made their collections, students then 
                                  proceeded to sort and count individual specimens 
                                  by lot sizes ranging from less than 1.0 centimeter 
                                  to 1.0-2.0 cm; 2.0-3.0 cm, etc. Having collected 
                                  and sorted the samples by lot size, students 
                                  were then asked to weigh and document their 
                                  collections and samples by lot size. Having 
                                  collected their information, they then proceeded 
                                  to add their information to the field forms 
                                  prepared for that purpose in an Excel table. 
                                  Having documented their samples, students then 
                                  made use of the Pocket PCs and single Powerbook 
                                  G4 laptop to enter their Wireless Journal entries 
                                  for the day. The student use of the Pocket PCs 
                                  went extraordinarily well with both the iPaq 
                                  3950 and Toshiba e740 (with wireless card upgrade) 
                                  PDA units.</p>

                                  Journal entries for the SBSC 224s/324s &quot;Flintknapping&quot; 
                                  or &#8220;Stone Tools&#8221; production lab 
                                  of Thursday, May 1st, 2003. This post was made 
                                  from a Mac Powerbook G4 laptop by wireless transmission 
                                  from the CSU Monterey Bay Building 110 Archaeology 
                                  Lab. Despite the fact that the Building 110 
                                  lab has no working telecommunications infrastructure 
                                  whatsoever, all Wireless Journal entries made 
                                  this day by students and myself to this portion 
                                  of the Wireless Technologies website and database 
                                  were made via wireless laptops and both Toshiba 
                                  e740 and Compaq iPaq 3950 Pocket PC's. It should 
                                  be noted that the Toshiba e740s worked extraordinarily 
                                  well. Prior use of the e740s from the CSU Monterey 
                                  Bay campus quad was somewhat unpredictable. 
                                  Given that we have since upgraded the wireless 
                                  cards on all five e740 units, and I have since 
                                  learned from campus CTO Gilbert Gonzales that 
                                  the campus quad is not &#8220;wired&#8221; for 
                                  wireless reception, I believe that we have achieved 
                                  considerable success given that all of the earlier 
                                  postings of wireless journals and data were 
                                  achieved in an environment deemed not to be 
                                  rigged for wireless telecommunications. Given 
                                  that fact, I will need to revisit student concerns 
                                  with the varied results that we achieved in 
                                  the campus quad areas. In addition, one other 
                                  finding from the project, and particularly the 
                                  Wireless Transect Surveys conducted in February, 
                                  is that many areas of the campus quad do in 
                                  fact have wireless connectivity, even if only 
                                  by default. We believe that the wireless connectivity 
                                  achieved in the quad areas was a byproduct of 
                                  a wireless bleed from existing wireless connectivity 
                                  previously thought to work only within those 
                                  buildings configured for wireless. In other 
                                  words, we should not have been able to connect 
                                  to the Internet or post Wireless Journals or 
                                  enter wireless Site Catalog Tool database entries 
                                  from the campus quad at CSU Monterey Bay. Even 
                                  so, Gilbert Gonzales and the IT team here at 
                                  CSU Monterey Bay are now looking into what needs 
                                  to be configured for wireless beyond those areas 
                                  on 6th street currently targeted for the installation 
                                  of wireless antennas purchased by my colleague 
                                  Dr. Yong Lao.</p>

                                  On Tuesday, April 29th students met in the Building 
                                  110 Archaeology Lab to participate in a flintknapping 
                                  demonstration conducted by me for the purposes 
                                  of preparing students for their own participation 
                                  in the lab exercise in question. At that time 
                                  I demonstrated the effective use of hard and 
                                  soft hammer percussion, indirect percussion, 
                                  and pressure flaking methods for stone tool 
                                  production. In the process of demonstrating 
                                  the varied techniques in question, I also succeeded 
                                  in creating a debris field or lithic scatter 
                                  that will be the subject of ongoing analysis 
                                  by students for the end term project. The demonstration 
                                  in question ran from about 10:30 am to 11:40 
                                  am. Today, Thursday, May 1, 2003, Wireless Project 
                                  student assistant Rob Lecel prepared two additional 
                                  areas for the flintknapping exercises. A gridded 
                                  tarp, like that used in past experiments, was 
                                  anchored with duct tape to the floor areas on 
                                  the north end of the building. The grid in question 
                                  is composed of 20 x 20 centimeter units configured 
                                  within an alphanumerically designed grid pattern. 
                                  The unit numbers as such span the range from 
                                  A1 through Q13. Students were assembled about 
                                  the main grid at the center of the lab and instructed 
                                  to obtain a pair of leather gloves, goggles, 
                                  a leather flintknapping pad, an antler tine, 
                                  and a cobble or pebble provided as part of the 
                                  flintknapping tool kit. Students were again 
                                  reminded of the importance of taking precautions 
                                  and following protocols closely to avoid mishaps. 
                                  In addition, I asked that students await my 
                                  specific instructions or other guidance. Students 
                                  were then provided with a chunk of obsidian 
                                  for the exercise. Students were given that period 
                                  from about 10:15 am to about 11:10 am to work 
                                  on perfecting their abilities to strike or create 
                                  a primary flake worthy of retouch or other modification. 
                                  After having added to the debris field or lithic 
                                  scatter, students were then asked to reconstitute 
                                  their respective groups and to select Unit numbers 
                                  from the bucket of index cards replete with 
                                  individual unit numbers. In this way students 
                                  were asked to select five individual units for 
                                  a random sampling of units from the area of 
                                  the gridded tarp constituting the debris field. 
                                  Having done this, students were then asked to 
                                  collect every piece of lithic debris contained 
                                  within those units selected by random sample. 
                                  Having made their collections, students then 
                                  proceeded to sort and count individual specimens 
                                  by lot sizes ranging from less than 1.0 centimeter 
                                  to 1.0-2.0 cm; 2.0-3.0 cm, etc. Having collected 
                                  and sorted the samples by lot size, students 
                                  were then asked to weigh and document their 
                                  collections and samples by lot size. Having 
                                  collected their information, they then proceeded 
                                  to add their information to the field forms 
                                  prepared for that purpose in an Excel table. 
                                  Having documented their samples, students then 
                                  made use of the Pocket PCs and single Powerbook 
                                  G4 laptop to enter their Wireless Journal entries 
                                  for the day. The student use of the Pocket PCs 
                                  went extraordinarily well with both the iPaq 
                                  3950 and Toshiba e740 (with wireless card upgrade)

                                  Today's SBSC 224s/324s (Archaeology: From Map 
                                  to Museum) course returned to the Building 110 
                                  Archaeology Lab to pursue the penultimate lab 
                                  session devoted to stone tool reduction processes. 
                                  Students were given the incentive to produce 
                                  the makings of a bifacial tool with a distinctive 
                                  flake tool pattern. I announced from the lab 
                                  that the student who comes closest to producing 
                                  the best pressure or percussion-flake pattern 
                                  on at least one edge of their bifacial tool 
                                  will receive an additional 10 percentage points 
                                  of extra credit toward the final grade for the 
                                  term. The runner up will receive an additional 
                                  5 percentage points of extra credit. A Lab Report 
                                  assessment form was distributed and discussed 
                                  for the purposes of addressing the specifics 
                                  of that content required for the final lab report. 
                                  At present, the stone tool having the most distinctive 
                                  flake tool characteristics and form is that 
                                  of Rob Lecel...who it turns out is one of the 
                                  Wireless Project student assistants. I will 
                                  be permitting all students one more opportunity 
                                  in Tuesday's lab to produce the flake tool pattern 
                                  sought. Finally, while we did not have an opportunity 
                                  to post wireless journals or data, I have taken 
                                  the opportunity here to post this singular wireless 
                                  journal entry.</p>

                                  This is a test of the D-Link Air Wireless card 
                                  used on a Toshiba e748 Pocket PC. This card 
                                  used on the Toshiba appears to have a much faster 
                                  and more robust signal than the HP wireless 
                                  cards used on the iPaq 3955s. This test post 
                                  was transmitted from CSU Monterey Bay Building 
                                  110 Archaeology Lab. This area is not otherwise

                                  Todays final Stone Tools lab took place in the 
                                  CSU Monterey Bay Building 110 Archaeology Lab 
                                  and students were directed to conduct one of 
                                  two tasks. Those wishing to compete for the 
                                  extra credit Stone Tools challenge were given 
                                  the opportunity to do so by way of the creation 
                                  of stone tool flake patterns that best represent 
                                  both percussion and pressure flaking patterns. 
                                  I have offered students the opportunity to compete 
                                  for a 10% points of extra credit for the best 
                                  flake tool pattern produced in a biface, and 
                                  the runner up will compete for an additional 
                                  5% points of extra credit for the next best 
                                  example produced. Students not wishing to compete 
                                  in the Lab Challenge this day were asked to 
                                  conduct one additional sampling of the gridded 
                                  stone tool production area for the purposes 
                                  of latter analysis. Because of this late date 
                                  in the semester, this student cohort will not 
                                  be required to enter the data for that challenge, 
                                  particularly as we have been working out the 
                                  technical issues with the newly posted stone 
                                  tools or Flintknapping data base. I have instructed 
                                  the students to meet in the Building 18, Room 
                                  156 computer lab for the last class session 
                                  which will on Thursday of this week. At that 
                                  time I will present an overview of that information 
                                  learned from the Wireless Technologies Project, 
                                  the Modern Material Cultures Lab (Garbology), 
                                  and Flintknapping labs. The second hour will 
                                  be dominated by videotaped exit interviews with 
                                  student participants this semester. Finally, 
                                  it should be noted that students posted the 
                                  results or observations of their experience 
                                  with the stone tools lab this day. I noted in 
                                  a previous post that the D-Link Wireless cards 
                                  ordered for the Toshiba e740s has significantly 
                                  enhanced the speed and efficiency, as well as 
                                  the bandwidth concerns originally had with the 
                                  internal cards germane to the Toshiba units. 
                                  The Toshiba's now outperform the iPaq units 
                                  with the HP cards. Overall, I believe that given 
                                  the experimental nature of this project, and 
                                  the on campus use of wireless technologies -- 
                                  when wireless access in outdoor and common areas 
                                  was not yet configured -- proved itself a success. 
                                  Perhaps the largest issue for students was the 
                                  difficulty of using the smaller keypad area 
                                  of the Pocket PCs when wireless laptops were 
                                  available. Interestingly, whenever the laptop 
                                  units were unavailable, the students readily 
                                  took to entering and posting their journals 
                                  via the PDA or Pocket PCs.</p>

                                  Today, the SBS 224s/324s Archaeology: Map to 
                                  Museum class conducted the wireless transect 
                                  survey on the CSUMB campus. The survey covered 
                                  approximately 250 paces across the main quad, 
                                  and students were directed to document any and 
                                  all traces of human endeavor, including sidewalks, 
                                  trash, fixtures, and related debris. The experiment 
                                  was limited by the fact that the wireless signal 
                                  was not up to par...particularly as we are relying 
                                  on the wireless bleed from campus buildings 
                                  oriented to the quad. Apparently, we also neglected 
                                  to enter the site name (CSUMB) in all upper 
                                  case letters, and as a result, the Compaqs did 
                                  not all connect in a timely fashion; although 
                                  we were able to reestablish signal for Online 
                                  Journal postings in front of the CSUMB Library...from 
                                  which this post was transmitted at approximately 
                                  4:02 pm on October 14, 2003. Overall, the transect 
                                  survey was a success in that the students demonstrated 
                                  their interest and enthusiasm in the effort 
                                  overall. Group 3 was unable to complete the 
                                  summary as they had too much info to input in 
                                  so short a time (ca. 1 hour for survey).</p>

                                  Today was the second week and second collection 
                                  for this semester's SBS 224s/324s garbology 
                                  project crew. One group produced a sample that 
                                  included post Halloween candy, condom wrappers 
                                  and used condoms, wine bottle corks, and assorted 
                                  illicit materials. The time is 3:14 pm and the 
                                  final crew is still in the Science Building 
                                  courtyard working on sorting their respective 
                                  samples. Clearly, the garbage samples were much 
                                  more diverse and full than was the case last 
                                  week. Because of the lack of electrical outlets 
                                  in the Science Building courtyard, I have been 
                                  unable to provide an electronic weight scale 
                                  but plan on remedying this with the use of a 
                                  battery operated electronic scale. One primary 
                                  difference this week over last is that I have 
                                  included a &quot;Weekly Garbology Profile&quot; 
                                  or questionnaire to be completed by students 
                                  each week as part of their evolving efforts 
                                  to identify and or characterize the occupants 
                                  of the home from which the sample was derived. 
                                  Otherwise, all is going smoothly so far. This 
                                  journal entry has been entered via wireless 
                                  transmission from the Science Building courtyard. 
                                  The entry was prepared on a Compaq wireless 
                                  Tablet PC.</p>

                                  On this day we initiated the Spring 2004 field 
                                  season at the Carmel Mission project site (CA-MNT-18). 
                                  A new group of about 27 students is matriculated 
                                  for the term, and we selected some six new units 
                                  for exploratory soundings. First, students were 
                                  asked to draw the numbers 1 through 8 from a 
                                  bucket, and then, depending on their priority 
                                  in the numbers from 1 through 8, students then 
                                  selected a second set of Unit numbers drawn 
                                  from a bucket. This then determined which students 
                                  groups were assigned to which units. Students 
                                  were permitted to self select their own team 
                                  members. They were also to select a Team leader 
                                  or captain. That individiual or team leader 
                                  then selected the Unit number from the bucket 
                                  of unit numbers. Having done that, students 
                                  were directed to produce notes describing their 
                                  respective unit areas. Having done that, they 
                                  were then instructed in basic procedures and 
                                  directed to initiate excavation procedures.

                                  assisted in directing students, and that info 
                                  provided the team leaders was then conveyed 
                                  through them and the project assistants to all 
                                  other students on an ongoing basis. Today we 
                                  opened six new units of those that remain. New 
                                  units include B2, E3, F4, H2, I1, and I4. In 
                                  addition to a single shard of Galera ware with 
                                  a tin-enameled interior, and a buff colored 
                                  exterior, was recovered by one group. A bird 
                                  skull, possibly a pelican, was recovered in 
                                  one of the units. The wireless system was successful 
                                  only to the extent that a single laptop was 
                                  on wireless...but wired to the modems. Apparently, 
                                  the technician believes that the access points 
                                  were somehow reset and settings deleted. We 
                                  will endeavor to correct this problem by next 
                                  week so that students are not in the position 
                                  of having to await others in inputting their 
                                  wireless journals. Otherwise, we had a very 
                                  successful day in so far as instruction and 
                                  training was concerned. The pastor has noted 
                                  that the otherwise torn and tattered plastic 
                                  frameworks that we use to cover the units are 
                                  an eyesore for wedding photographers. I have 
                                  offered to dismantle the PVC frameworks in question 
                                  and replace them with large tarps. The time 
                                  is 4:37 pm and we are preparing to depart.</p>
