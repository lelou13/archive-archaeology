                                  Mission Project excavation. Journal entries 
                                  posted here will be posted primarily from the 
                                  field via wireless Pocket PCs or laptop base 
                                  stations. Transmission will be via Pocket PC 
                                  interface, laptop base station and server, access 
                                  points, and DirecWay satellite dish transmission 
                                  to the Institute for Archaeology server located 
                                  within the Instructional Technologies building 
                                  on the CSU Monterey Bay campus. With the exception 
                                  of this initial transmission, this Wireless 
                                  Journal site is intended for wireless entries 
                                  from the Carmel Mission only.</p>

                                  This is the first successful test of the Wireless 
                                  Journal using a Compaq Evo N610c wireless laptop 
                                  base station from the Carmel Mission. Transmission 
                                  of this journal entry was by way of broadband 
                                  satellite installed this day at the Carmel Mission. 
                                  This is a milestone for our Wireless Technologies 
                                  in Archaeology Project. The laptop base station 
                                  has been successfully configured and tested 
                                  as a remote base station for remote transmissions 
                                  of Wireless Journals via wireless PDAs or Pocket 
                                  PCs.</p>

                                  Today we re-initiated wireless transmissions 
                                  from the Carmel Mission (CA-MNT-18). Despite 
                                  the threat of rain, Christian Graves (Project 
                                  Technician) set up and reconfigured the PDA's 
                                  for use with two new Linksys Wireless Signal 
                                  Boosters. An apparent incongruity between the 
                                  booster and the individual PDA's delayed deployment 
                                  of the PDA's this day. Individual PDA's were 
                                  problemmatic to connect this day despite correcting 
                                  the Booster conflict. Recommendation is to look 
                                  to use of laptops over PDA's for field applications 
                                  that require weekly onsite initialization and 
                                  re-initialization of the wireless network.</p>

                                  This Wireless Journal posting is being composed 
                                  and transmitted from beneath the former canopy 
                                  used here at the Carmel Mission (CA-MNT-18). 
                                  This morning upon arriving on site at the Carmel 
                                  Mission we found the remains of the canopy used 
                                  to cover the Structure 1 excavation area during 
                                  the course of the past week. Due to a severe 
                                  storm that disrupted last Saturday's excavation 
                                  schedule, we were unable to dismantle the canopy 
                                  due to the lack of person-power available to 
                                  see through the dismantling of said canopy. 
                                  The canopy was essentially destroyed and we 
                                  dismantled and discarded the metal frame and 
                                  I am using the canopy's fabric cover to shield 
                                  the wireless laptop base-station and access 
                                  points from the current downpour. Because of 
                                  the intensity of the rains we have been forced 
                                  to shift our operations to the Crespi Hall Archaeology 
                                  Lab. Excavations have been halted so as to preclude 
                                  damage to the excavation and related features. 
                                  We continue to transmit Wireless Journal entries 
                                  and data despite the rains. However, given the 
                                  intensity of the rains, and our desire to avoid 
                                  damage to wireless technologies currently being 
                                  used, this will be our last wireless transmission 
                                  from the Carmel Mission for this day. We anticipate 
                                  being able to return to excavations tomorrow...depending 
                                  on prevailing weather conditions. As noted earlier, 
                                  glitches with the PDA's delayed our setup and 
                                  deployment of the wireless system this day. 
                                  Recommendation: Purchase additional laptops 
                                  or Touch Pads for use in the field.</p>

                                  10:00 am Saturday, May 3rd, 2003: Due to the 
                                  threat of severe storms and a predicted 2&quot; 
                                  rainfall for Friday, May 2nd, 2003, I cancelled 
                                  the field day at the Carmel Mission in order 
                                  to have students meet at the campus for lab 
                                  time. During the course of yesterday's lab in 
                                  Building 18, Room 156 students were directed 
                                  to coordinate with SBS student Paul Alexander 
                                  for the purposes of developing their respective 
                                  poster sessions. Students are currently preparing 
                                  graphics intensive full color posters centered 
                                  on the archaeology of Mission San Carlos Borromeo 
                                  del Rio Carmelo (CA-MNT-18). Students have been 
                                  subdivided into groups of five or so students 
                                  each. Each team has then been directed to produce 
                                  the text, and select the images and illustrations 
                                  that will complement their respective poster 
                                  or caption. The posters or captions will measure 
                                  roughly 14&#8221; x 32&#8221; in size and will

                                  During that period during which students worked 
                                  on their posters in Building 18, Room 156, I 
                                  directed Wireless Project staff to the Building 
                                  110 Archaeology Lab for the purposes of processing 
                                  both Carmel and San Juan Bautista artifact and 
                                  specimen types to be entered via wireless transmission 
                                  from the Building 110 Archaeology Lab. Project 
                                  staffs, including Michelle St. Claire, Hanna 
                                  Daleo, Amy Gotshalk-Stine and Rob Lecel were 
                                  present to see through the tasks. Hanna Daleo 
                                  coordinated the lab efforts for the day and 
                                  worked through lunch to see the task through 
                                  to completion. Rob Lecel completed the day at 
                                  5:30 pm by assisting me with the organization 
                                  and securing of lab materials and equipment. 
                                  Michelle conducted wireless data entry and Amy 
                                  processed San Juan Bautista specimens by way 
                                  of sorting unsorted material types. The day 
                                  proved quite productive, although I was a bit 
                                  disappointed at having had to cancel the day 
                                  at the Carmel Mission&#8230;particularly as 
                                  the forecasted rainfall did not fully materialize 
                                  until about noon, at which time students would 
                                  have wrapped up excavation efforts at the mission.</p>

                                  Arrived on site this day at about 8:30 am with 
                                  Christian Graves the Wireless Project technician. 
                                  Despite an early departure, I found it necessary 
                                  to meet both Rob Lecel and Amy Gotshalk-Stine 
                                  at the CSU Monterey Bay Building 110 Archaeology 
                                  Lab in order to retrieve easels for this day's 
                                  Archaeology Open House event. Upon arriving 
                                  on site I met my students who were already assembled 
                                  in the courtyard at the Carmel Mission and we 
                                  immediately proceeded to post the captioned 
                                  panels and posters developed by the students 
                                  for the Archaeology Open House. The panels were 
                                  prepared by the students and the layout was 
                                  developed by Paul Alexander (SBS Student Assistant). 
                                  The panels were a wonderful addition to the 
                                  Open House and provided a comprehensive overview 
                                  of the project and its accomplishments in terms 
                                  of both archaeology and wireless technologies 
                                  deployment. In addition, we posted several posters 
                                  that featured the Garbology or Modern Materials 
                                  Cultures project developed by the SBSC 224s/324s 
                                  students in concert with wireless project tools, 
                                  including Pocket PCs and laptops. In addition 
                                  to ongoing excavations, captioned panels, and 
                                  artifact displays, I conducted a stone tools 
                                  or flintknapping demonstration for the public. 
                                  All went quite well and we were all quite gratified 
                                  at the many questions and visitors who had questions 
                                  of the students and I. In addition, one of the 
                                  more significant efforts on the project this 
                                  day, in addition to significant progress in 
                                  Units F1 and I2 which revealed flooring materials, 
                                  Rob Lecel and Chris Lack conducted a wireless 
                                  project Exit Interview in questions about the 
                                  technology and its applications in archaeology 
                                  were conducted on DV format tape. This same 
                                  Exit Interview was conducted for my students 
                                  in SBSC 224s/324s who were also quite involved 
                                  in the wireless technologies applications as 
                                  applied on the CSUMB campus. We began collecting 
                                  tools and equipment and shutting down the efforts 
                                  for the day at about 4:20 pm and upon reloading 
                                  all Open House and archaeology tools and supplies, 
                                  we are just now departing at 6:00 pm. All staff 
                                  and the remaining two students on site this 
                                  afternoon posted brief Wireless Journal entries. 
                                  Overall, I believe that the Open House was a 
                                  great success, and as noted by Michelle St.Claire,

                                  as the result of the reformatting of the laptop 
                                  base station due to a hardware failure, Christian 
                                  Graves, Rob Lecel, and myself have returned 
                                  to the Carmel Mission to recalibrate the systems.</p>

                                  Rudy Rosales is here today to review our work 
                                  on the site. He informs me that the orientation 
                                  for the San Carlos chapel is identical to that 
                                  of the San Carlos Borromeo Basilica. This is 
                                  a test.</p>

                                  transmission from the Carmel Mission Archaeological 
                                  Project excavation site (CA-MNT-18)at 3:44 pm 
                                  on Friday, June 13th, 2003. Today, at approximately 
                                  3:25 pm, wireless project technician Christian 
                                  Graves took a photo of Mr. Coleman and I with 
                                  the new Ricoh RDC-i700 image capturing device 
                                  now being deployed by the project for wireless 
                                  image capture and posting to the Internet. The 
                                  image was taken and posted by way of FTP through 
                                  the wireless camera from within the excavation 
                                  areas. We will soon be uploading a template 
                                  so as to be able to post images in real-time 
                                  from the archaeological dig area itself. We 
                                  are particularly excited about this new technology 
                                  as it will permit us to produce and transmit 
                                  images by way of wireless signal from any project 
                                  site from which we can obtain a wireless signal. 
                                  My longer range plan is to prepare images of 
                                  specimens as they are recovered from the dig 
                                  site and have these transmitted and posted to 
                                  the Internet database in real-time. The Ricoh 
                                  camera will permit us to email, FTP, and post 
                                  to html in real-time from the project site on 
                                  an ongoing basis. So, stay posted for future 
                                  image captures and transmissions.</p>

                                  Dear Bob, I am emailing you a response from 
                                  our wireless archaeology remote base station 
                                  at the Carmel Mission dig site. We sponsored 
                                  an open house for a two day Wireless Technologies 
                                  Symposium held at CSU Monterey Bay. Today, we 
                                  hosted some 30 faculty, Chief Technology Officers, 
                                  and CEO types from both CSU Monterey Bay and 
                                  Western Michigan University. See http://archaeology.csumb.edu/wireless 
                                  or http://wireless_archaeology.csumb.edu for 
                                  updates at the &quot;Wireless Journals&quot; 
                                  page for those aspects of the online database 
                                  that may be viewed by the public. All else is 
                                  currently password protected, particularly all 
                                  specimens recovered, processed, and cataloged 
                                  in the field with the help of an Internet-based 
                                  database accessed via wireless transmission. 
                                  In addition, we finally deployed the wireless 
                                  Ricoh RDC-i700 digital capture device and we 
                                  are now taking photos of excavation units (and 
                                  specimens in the field) and sending them via 
                                  wireless transmission from the excavation areas 
                                  at the Carmel Mission directly to the online 
                                  (Internet) database and wireless base-station 
                                  with the click of a button. This operation, 
                                  which was funded by a congressional appropriation 
                                  has allowed us to learn a great deal about the 
                                  potentials of wireless technologies in archaeology. 
                                  The best part of the whole operation is that 
                                  now that we have a wireless (remote) field laboratory 
                                  setup, replete with some 10 pocket PC's, four 
                                  laptops, a host of peripherals, and, last but 
                                  not least, satellite transmitters installed 
                                  at both Carmel and San Juan Bautista, we are 
                                  now able to create, manage, and manipulate any 
                                  and all data for both California Missions via 
                                  wireless Internet access. Finally, I wanted 
                                  to let you know that beginning on June 30th 
                                  we will be conducting a Ground Penetrating Radar 
                                  survey for any and all earlier structures built 
                                  at the Carmel Mission in the period from 1771 
                                  through 1834. That California Missions Foundation 
                                  funded survey is being coordinated with one 
                                  other funded project that will result in a Geographic 
                                  Information Systems modelling of the San Carlos 
                                  Borromeo del Rio Carmelo and San Juan Bautista 
                                  mission project sites by the end of summer. 
                                  Beginning next week will commence the Global 
                                  Positioning Systems mapping of the entire complex 
                                  for the purposes of more accurately anchoring 
                                  the Ground Penetrating Radar and all other survey 
                                  mapping data pertaining to the architectural 
                                  history of both Mission project sites. I am 
                                  sure that you will appreciate the potentials 
                                  of the GPR survey given your own recent GPR 
                                  mapping of Mission San Antonio. Otherwise, I 
                                  look forward to seeing you there at San Antonio 
                                  in the coming weeks. With Utmost Regards, Ruben

                                  On this day we hosted a group from the Wireless 
                                  Technologies in Education Symposium being hosted 
                                  by CSU Monterey Bay. The symposium, which spanned 
                                  both Thursday, June 19th and Friday, June 20th, 
                                  ended with our real-time, hands-on, wireless 
                                  demonstration project presentation out here 
                                  at the Carmel Mission. The participants, who 
                                  numbered about 30 or so included CIO's, faculty, 
                                  and others from both campuses. I believe that 
                                  the project and this final day of demonstrations 
                                  were a great success, particularly as we were 
                                  able to generate a considerable amount of interest 
                                  among the participants about the way we had 
                                  developed and deployed the wireless technologies 
                                  at this site. Moreover, I was quite proud of 
                                  my wireless project crew, including Rob Lecel, 
                                  Amy Gotshalk-Stine, and Christian Graves, who 
                                  were here to see through this last day on the 
                                  Wireless Project for this semester. Other project 
                                  volunteers this day included Lynn Carr, Susan 
                                  Morley, Ms. Foley, and other project volunteers. 
                                  I was particularly proud of Christian as he 
                                  came through to see through this final demonstration 
                                  and a presentation...he was applauded repeatedly 
                                  by the Wireless Symposium participants for his 
                                  role in developing, deploying, trouble-shooting, 
                                  and maintaining the Internet database applications 
                                  and technology infrastructure required for the 
                                  successful deployment of wireless technologies 
                                  in archaeology. While it may or may not be the 
                                  case that we are among the first, if not the 
                                  first, to deploy satellite-mediated wireless 
                                  data management via the Internet from remote 
                                  field sites in archaeology, the real reward 
                                  from this project has been the fact that this 
                                  project was entirely facilitated by the students 
                                  and staff of CSU Monterey Bay and wireless project 
                                  technical freelancer, Christian Graves. Otherwise, 
                                  I do believe that we made a great go of it...and 
                                  you should see the many images that clearly

                                  do in fact require quite a few wires to succeed.</p>

                                  After a project hiatus during which the Wireless 
                                  network was note used at Mission San Carlos 
                                  Borromeo del Rio Carmelo (i.e., Summer 2003), 
                                  we are back on-line as of today. Today's Online 
                                  Journal or Field Journal entries will be input 
                                  via the Compaq Evo N610c base station laptop. 
                                  The current time is approximately 12:13 pm on 
                                  September 12, 2003. I have instructed both matriculated 
                                  students and project volunteers to input Online 
                                  Journal entries documenting this day in the 
                                  field. Unfortunately, during the course of the 
                                  summer the PDA units lost power as a result 
                                  of not being charged during the course of the 
                                  wireless project hiatus. We now realize that 
                                  the PDA programs that were added to allow wireless 
                                  access have as a result been lost to the PDA 
                                  unit. We will need to reload the programs from 
                                  the desktop units at my home prior to proceeding 
                                  with the use of wireless PDA's in the coming 
                                  weeks. Today, we will remain focused on the 
                                  use of the laptop base-station.</p>

                                  The field day began at approximately 8:30 am 
                                  with the arrival of the last of the registered 
                                  students matriculated into the SBS 260s/360s 
                                  field class. The first assignment was to have 
                                  the students complete Lab Deliverable 2 (Munsell 
                                  Soil Chart Readings). Students conducted both 
                                  wet and dry soils smears with corallary readings 
                                  as per actual colors. As with last weeks Friday 
                                  field session, we once again set up the wireless 
                                  base station and a secondary Compaq (Wireless) 
                                  Table PC...which is being deployed for the first 
                                  time today. The Compaq Tablet PC has proven 
                                  a wonderfully versatile tool for wireless technology 
                                  applications in archaeology. In addition to 
                                  the Windows Journal feature which permits the 
                                  use of handwritten notes that may be saved and 
                                  emailed or posted in *.mhtm format (a variation 
                                  of *.html),the detachable PDA like monitor provides 
                                  a great medium within which to explore new and 
                                  innovative applications in archaeology (map 
                                  making, handwritten notes and diagrams, and 
                                  voice actuated transcription). As of this moment, 
                                  the plan is to have both the PDA's and Tablet 
                                  PC's running on wireless connectivity as of 
                                  next week. Excavations proceeded in units F2 
                                  (Level 1), G3 (Level 3), G4 (Level 5), and the 
                                  H4 pit unit to 90 cm. In addition to Munsell 
                                  readings in each unit, students posted both 
                                  wet and dry readings from various units located 
                                  onsite. Excavations in Unit E4 were reinitiated 
                                  and student assistant Rob Lecel cleared the 
                                  unit to the lowest portion of the existing floor 
                                  feature. Within the H4 pit structure, bone, 
                                  and shell, and tile materials were recovered 
                                  from a lower level and the unit appears to be 
                                  tapering to a rounded base...thereby suggesting 
                                  the actual depth of the original pit excavation. 
                                  Finally, in addition to the initial use of the 
                                  Tablet PC on site, we also deployed the portable 
                                  battery storage unit and it has succeeded in 
                                  keeping the Mac laptop juiced for the whole 
                                  of the day...and given that that laptop is used 
                                  for posting student hours, it has been most 
                                  helpful in that it has allowed us to maintain 
                                  electricity within the excavation site itself. 
                                  This journal post is being completed at 4:44 
                                  pm. We will soon be loading and departing the 
                                  site for the day.</p>

                                  The project day began at 8:30 am with the assembly 
                                  of the students in the excavation areas in front 
                                  of the Carmel Mission Basilica church. Students 
                                  immediately began mobilizing around the setup 
                                  of the lab and processing areas. Flo Miller, 
                                  who has contributed significantly to the setup 
                                  of the lab areas, was essentially prepared to 
                                  participate for only a portion of the day due 
                                  to a work conflict. We will be coordinating 
                                  other times for project contributions with Flo 
                                  who has proven an invaluable asset to the Carmel 
                                  Mission Archaeological Project. Sir Richard 
                                  Joseph Menn, the Diocesan Curator, came out 
                                  to visit with me at the top of the morning, 
                                  and we discussed findings to date and related 
                                  matters. We spoke about the architectural history 
                                  project that students Rob Lecel and Kyle Thompson 
                                  are working to see through. We hope to have 
                                  the project in question featured at the upcoming 
                                  California Missions Foundation meetings in San 
                                  Luis Obispo. Because Dr. Robert Hoover and Thomas 
                                  Senkewicz and Rosemary Beebe have repeatedly 
                                  attempted to have me attend the meeting in question. 
                                  Due to issues related to the Monterey meetings 
                                  that I was restricted from participating in, 
                                  I have not attended a meeting with said group 
                                  for the past three years. My own paper will 
                                  center on the topic of archaeoastronomy in the 
                                  California missions. The day continued with 
                                  the installation and setup of equipment pertaining 
                                  to the wireless project. Due to a glitch in 
                                  obtaining a connection for the rest of the wireless 
                                  devices (beyond the base station), I made repeated 
                                  attempts to connect or establish a connection 
                                  for the wireless laptops and PDA devices. After 
                                  nearly an hour and a half, both Rob Lecel and 
                                  I were able to obtain a connection. A new student 
                                  volunteer from Monterey Peninsula College, Jennifer 
                                  Lopez, began work this day and I assigned both 
                                  she and Morgan Keach to Unit H1 (Level 3). Interesting 
                                  finds of the day include a flintknappers hammer 
                                  stone recovered from Unit G3 (Level 3). The 
                                  hammer stone in question is heavily battered 
                                  and two distinct surfaces of the stone are clearly 
                                  pecked and pitted from repeated use as a hammer 
                                  stone. One side of the stone, which bears red 
                                  ochre and fire marks, is heavily flaked and 
                                  appears to have been used to batter materials 
                                  of a harder consistency. The hammer stone in 
                                  question lay immediately adjacent and slightly 
                                  below several ladrillo or floor tile fragments. 
                                  Student Marvin Dillard was quite excited about 
                                  his finds and I photographed him with the hammer 
                                  stone...and in turn explained its significance 
                                  and use by the Native American (Esselen) peoples 
                                  who once inhabited the Carmel Mission. In addition 
                                  to this find, volunteer Jennifer Lopez and student 
                                  Morgan keach encountered a significant deposit 
                                  of burnt redwood with the cambium or bark layer 
                                  still intact. We collected the sample in the 
                                  hopes of obtaining a radiocarbon date for the 
                                  collapse and destruction of the original building 
                                  that once housed the Serra Library (Structure 
                                  2). An artificial pearl was recovered from Unit 
                                  F2 (Level 2) and students Genetta Butler and 
                                  Stephanie-Kneeshaw Price were quite excited 
                                  at their find. I should note that during the 
                                  course of the field day, the students were confronted 
                                  by a rude and controntational catering assistant 
                                  who was present on site for the purposes of 
                                  preparing foods in the Crespi Hall reception 
                                  area. The issue of their right to obtain coffee 
                                  in the kitchen led the individual in question 
                                  to later confront me in a loud and abuse manner, 
                                  and I informed him that I thought that he was 
                                  loud and disrespectful, and that the real problem 
                                  was his lack of respect for my students and 
                                  I. He backed off, but later confronted us at 
                                  the end of his day and was similarly loud and 
                                  obnoxious. Anyway, we got past that problem, 
                                  and as it turned out, we started our day with 
                                  a funeral, worked around two weddings, a confrontational 
                                  cook, and ended the day with a wedding in which 
                                  the brides maids and virtually everyone else 
                                  in the party wore basic black. The great thing 
                                  about this wedding, in addition to my obtaining 
                                  video footage of the church bells, was the presence 
                                  of a mariachi band of eight members playing 
                                  all of my favorite tunes. In fact, their standing 
                                  right behind our make-shift field lab playing 
                                  &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; as I type these field 
                                  notes. Anyway, I've been awake since 2:30 am 
                                  this morning due to a manuscript deadline, so 
                                  perhaps that tune about the &quot;Cucaracha...and 
                                  marijuana pa fumar&quot; is just my lack of 
                                  sleep. But no, actually, this is really happening, 
                                  and it could only be happening in a California 
                                  Mission. The time is 4:18 pm, and volunteers 
                                  Dave Grant and Diane DiGuiseppe just left the 
                                  site, and only Kyle Thompson (working well into 
                                  level 8 of the floor of Unit E4), and Genetta 
                                  Butler and Stephanie Kneeshaw-Price and I remain 
                                  on site to tear down the lab. Anyway, that was 
                                  our day, and next week, I will be on writing 
                                  retreat in Tucson working with linguist David 
                                  Leedom Shaul on a co-authored manuscript on

                                  The time is 4:25 pm and the mariachi band is 
                                  still playing. Great stuff! Reminds me of my

                                  At approximately 2:50 pm today, Dave Grant, 
                                  working in Unit H3 has begun to expose the hilt 
                                  of an antique bayonet found lodged in the matrix 
                                  of the conglomerate layer in said unit. The 
                                  hilt and a portion of the bayonet blade is still 
                                  intact, although heavily rusted. Dave is working 
                                  to pedestal the hilt for the purposes of photographs 
                                  and related measurement and documentation. Earlier 
                                  today, in Unit G2, Diane DiGuiseppe recovered 
                                  a large deposit of charcoal embedded within 
                                  the conglomerate layer. Although the conglomerate 
                                  likely dates to the period of the restoration 
                                  of the Sala of 1920, the deposit itself likely 
                                  predates said period. The time is 3:07 pm and 
                                  another bridal couple just entered the threshold 
                                  of the church for a wedding ceremony.</p>

                                  Earlier today I met with Sister Celeste Pagliarulo 
                                  who happened to be on site for the day. I learned 
                                  that she wrote a thesis on the subject of Sir 
                                  Harry Downie's conservation work at the Carmel 
                                  Mission. Apparently, her thesis served as a 
                                  key piece in the work of Templeton who cited 
                                  her in preparing his book on the Carmel Mission. 
                                  She has two forthcoming articles to be published 
                                  in the Southern California Quarterly that outline 
                                  what she learned from Sir Harry Downie as a 
                                  result of several in-depth interviews that she 
                                  conducted with Sir Harry. According to Sister 
                                  Celeste, Sir Harry Downie did in fact note the 
                                  existence of a wine cellar here at the Carmel 
                                  Mission. She indicated that he said quite little 
                                  about the wine cellar, but did emphasize that 
                                  she should &quot;mention that there was one 
                                  down there [i.e. a wine cellar beneath the convento].&quot; 
                                  She also noted an interesting vision that Sir 
                                  Harry noted in the area of the current museum 
                                  library. Apparently, one day while Sir Harrie 
                                  was in that area he saw an apparition of Father 
                                  Mestres standing in what is now a walled in 
                                  doorway near the corner of the room. Apparently, 
                                  Sir Harry learned that Father Mestres was often 
                                  ill and missed many services and prayer sessions, 
                                  and according to him, Father Mestres likely 
                                  returned to complete with his prayers. So as 
                                  to allay concerns about his reappearance, a 
                                  prayer vigil was held in an effort to satisfy 
                                  the unfullfilled prayers in question. The apparition 
                                  did not return. Antonia Fields (Munras) in turn 
                                  sought to return books given her by Father Mestres 
                                  as an acknowledgement of donations to the mission. 
                                  Apparently, Father Mestres made the practice 
                                  of giving away the Carmel Missions antique books 
                                  to donors, and Antonia Fields, who formerly 
                                  lived in the area of Salinas in an old rancho 
                                  style adobe, was a recipient of a number of 
                                  such books. According to Sister Celeste, Antonia 
                                  donated the books back to the Carmel Mission 
                                  via Sir Harry in order to avert being visited 
                                  by the spirit of Father Mestres. Finally, Sister 
                                  Celeste noted that Sir Harry noted to her that 
                                  two windows once opened into the area behind 
                                  the altar, and that Sir Harry had them filled 
                                  and plastered over. Apparently, the windows 
                                  dated to the time of Father Casanova who reroofed 
                                  the Carmel Mission church. It should be noted 
                                  that Sister Celeste noted this fact after I 
                                  asked her about whether or not Sir Harry had 
                                  ever mentioned a sunlight at the main altar. 
                                  She indicated that Sir Harrie noted that the 
                                  light from the windows in question had been 
                                  bothersome to visitors to the mission and he 
                                  had them sealed for that reason.</p>

                                  Today's wireless setup installation for the 
                                  Compaq and HP Tablet PC's required approximately 
                                  40 minutes. We completed installation and connection 
                                  approximately 15 minutes ago. Initiation of 
                                  the wireless link requires setup of the laptops 
                                  and Tablet PC's, Access Points, electrical connections 
                                  for all devices requiring electricity, and a 
                                  satellite pointing test and calibration. Today, 
                                  the second lab station laptop did not immediately 
                                  connect, and this was resolved by switching 
                                  the current configuration profile from the campus 
                                  profile to the site profile. In addition, prior 
                                  to recognizing this as the issue, we set to 
                                  cleaning the satellite dish with a dry cloth 
                                  which readily improved satellite reception. 
                                  We are currently at a satellite signal strength 
                                  of 86 and up and running. It should be noted 
                                  that on Tuesday of this week we ran a wireless 
                                  transect survey on the campus and were initially 
                                  unable to connect with the iPaq Pocket PC's 
                                  until we reset the campus profile from lower 
                                  case to upper case letters. Signal strength 
                                  and connectivity was immediately established 
                                  upon making the change noted.</p>

                                  The time is 1:19 pm on Friday, October 24, 2003, 
                                  and ash and smoke fall out from the Fort Ord 
                                  controlled burn continues to foul the air. The 
                                  amount of ash falling at the moment is such 
                                  that we are now finding it necessary to close 
                                  our laptops and cover our equipment so as to 
                                  keep ash out of the keyboards and drives of 
                                  our field equipment. Students have commented 
                                  all morning about eye and smoke inhalation issues. 
                                  Anyway, the controlled burn appears to have 
                                  run afoul of the changing wind conditions.</p>

                                  Progress this day was largely limited to the 
                                  screening and processing of materials pertaining 
                                  to recent excavations. Some progress was made 
                                  in the excavation of units F2, E4, and H3. The 
                                  processing of excavated materials from Unit 
                                  G3 were backlogged and Marvin Dillard spent 
                                  the day screening and processing said materials. 
                                  At about 2:00 pm a photographer from the local 
                                  newspaper, the Monterey Herald, was on site 
                                  with a journalist to photograph the mission 
                                  and our digs. Their purpose was to report on 
                                  progress related to the $10 million dollar appropriation 
                                  for California mission restoration currently 
                                  under review by congress. The House of Representatives 
                                  approved the conditions of the appropriation, 
                                  and the Senate is currently reviewing the appropriation 
                                  for final consideration and approval. The story 
                                  will feature a discussion of what impact that 
                                  said monies will have on the Diocese of Monterey 
                                  and its missions...of which the Diocese is in 
                                  charge of seven, or fully one third of the California 
                                  missions. In addition, while the interview and 
                                  photographs were underway, Father John Griffin 
                                  approached and was briefly interviewed by the 
                                  press. Father Edward Fitz-Henry was on site 
                                  to conduct a wedding, and after the wedding 
                                  asked for a brief tour of the archaeology areas. 
                                  He noted that he was quite interested in reproducing 
                                  the fountain here in the Carmel Basilica Church 
                                  forecourt for Mission San Juan Bautista's new 
                                  landscaped areas. After the interview with the 
                                  press, Ms. Jenssen of the Laperouse Society 
                                  was on site to have me conduct her through a 
                                  brief study of the mill stones here at San Carlos 
                                  Borromeo. I prepared blue index cards for use 
                                  as identification cards for each of the stones. 
                                  Each stone was numbered MS1 through MS6 (as 
                                  in Mill Stone 1-6). Each was measured and photographed, 
                                  and the measurements were transmitted by wireless 
                                  email from Carmel Mission as Ms. Jenssen waited. 
                                  The information was courtesy copied to Msgr. 
                                  Bellec of the French government in Paris. Just 
                                  Rob Lecel, Genetta, and Stephanie are on site 
                                  to finish up with packing equipment and securing 
                                  the site. We will return next Friday.</p>

                                  The day started at approximately 8:30 am with 
                                  the setup of the archaeology and lab areas. 
                                  The wireless base station and this secondary 
                                  laptop station were in operating order by 9:20 
                                  am. Signal strength on this clear, sunny, albeit 
                                  windy, day is at 81. We will be extricating 
                                  the hilt of the bayonet first exposed last friday 
                                  in Unit I3. In addition, we will continue work 
                                  in Units E4, F2, and G3. Today's lab effort 
                                  will entail having students conduct online and 
                                  wireless data entry, in addition to the Wireless 
                                  Journals that have now become customary for 
                                  the project this term. In essence, the setup 
                                  and takedown and use of the wireless system 
                                  at the Carmel Mission has essentially gone off 
                                  without a hitch. For the most part, we have 
                                  been able to obtain good signal strength and 
                                  wireless connectivity through the whole of the 
                                  courtyard each week that the wireless network 
                                  has been activated here at the mission. What 
                                  has in fact improved our ability to connect 
                                  in an efficient manner has been the checking 
                                  and cleaning of the satellite dish on a weekly 
                                  basis. Today, for instance, a cobweb and dust 
                                  reduced the signal strength from 81 to 71. Once 
                                  the cobweb was removed, signal strength was 
                                  increased to 81. And, so begins our day today!</p>

                                  Approximately 10 minutes ago, Stephanie Kneeshaw-Price 
                                  recovered a 1917 Lincoln Wheat Penny within 
                                  Unit F2 and from the context of the soil matrix 
                                  at Level 3 (Objective 30). At the very least, 
                                  the coin serves to date the stratum or deposit 
                                  in question to the period of 1917 or sometime 
                                  thereafter. If we assume at the most fundamental 
                                  level that the coin is not part of an intrusive 
                                  deposit or rodent burrow, which it does not 
                                  appear to be, we can then presume that the deposits 
                                  overlying the adobe melt over the floor of the 
                                  original building was a secondary deposit from 
                                  the period just prior to or about the time of 
                                  the reconstruction of the &quot;sala&quot; which 
                                  now serves as the Serra Memorial located within 
                                  the convento wing adjacent to the excavation 
                                  units. Because we have recovered a very hardpacked 
                                  concretion that would appear to consist of a 
                                  very sandy admixture of concrete or stucco and 
                                  sand, it may well be that the coin dates the 
                                  bottom of the concretion and thereby serves 
                                  to confirm my initial observation that the concretion 
                                  may well very well be associated with the replastering 
                                  and construction of the Serra Memorial sala 
                                  area in circa 1920.</p>

                                  This message is being sent via wireless Tablet 
                                  PC from the excavation areas. Due to the amount 
                                  of rainfall this day, I was unsure that we'd 
                                  persist to this point in the day. At present 
                                  only four students and myself remain on site. 
                                  Both Marvin Dillard and Morgan Keach departed 
                                  about 15 minutes ago. Both Genetta Butler and 
                                  Rob Lecel departed shortly after Genetta cut 
                                  her finger and required attention at the campus 
                                  clinic. Fifteen minutes ago Rob confirmed by 
                                  cell phone that Gennetta was doing well.</p>

                                  Despite a weeklong spate of weather predictions 
                                  that predicted rain, the morning began with 
                                  a sunny, albeit, clouded, sky. Students and 
                                  volunteers were directed to proceed directly 
                                  to the Carmel Mission. Because of the amount 
                                  of water captured within the units overlain 
                                  by the large blue tarp used for that purpose, 
                                  we spent about a half hour bailing water. One 
                                  of the units contained a sizeable mouse that 
                                  had slipped into one of the units and drowned 
                                  within the flooded section of the tarp. While 
                                  Rob decided to name the mouse &quot;Henry&quot;, 
                                  and proceeded to place him on a silver platter 
                                  used previously for cookies donated by Sir Richard 
                                  Menn, I directed Rob to remove the mouse from 
                                  the area of the digs. By the time that task 
                                  was completed, &quot;Henry&quot; was accompanied 
                                  by a cigarette butt or filter. By the time of 
                                  this journal entry at 10:45 am, we are now covering 
                                  the site so as to protect it against the gathering 
                                  storm clouds and beginning rains. Diane and 
                                  David (San Jose volunteers) brought one additional 
                                  canopy out and that is serving to cover a good 
                                  part of the excavation area. Only Rob Lecel, 
                                  who I have directed to open a new unit at B2 
                                  remains unprotected against the rains at this 
                                  moment. A primary objective of this day's efforts 
                                  is to recover and remove the hilt of the bayonet 
                                  first exposed over two weeks ago. In addition, 
                                  students Kyle Thompson (E4, L. 8), Genetta Butler 
                                  and Stephanie Kneeshaw-Price (F2, L. 3), Marvin 
                                  Dillard and Libby Rivera (G3, L. 4), Morgan 
                                  Keach (H1, L. 4), and volunteers Diane DiGuseppe 
                                  (G2, L. 4), and Dave Grant (H3, L. 4) are all 
                                  working their units to objective levels as noted. 
                                  The time is 10:55 am and the rains have begun 
                                  to intensify and students have scrambled to 
                                  more thoroughly cover the excavation areas for 
                                  protection of themselves and their excavation 
                                  units.</p>

                                  This wireless journal entry is being entered 
                                  from the Carmel Mission dig site (CA-MNT-18) 
                                  during the course of a rather vigorous storm. 
                                  We are having some difficulty keeping rain out 
                                  of some of the units, but as of 12:00 noon, 
                                  students are busily at work on their respective 
                                  units, although Kyle Thompson was forced to 
                                  relocate due to water seepage into his respective 
                                  unit. Students will shortly take a lunch break 
                                  and we hope for a break in the weather so that 
                                  we might continue otherwise unhindered in meeting 
                                  today's objectives. As per the wireless connections, 
                                  my primary concern is that I am working beneath 
                                  a canopy that is deflecting its fare share of 
                                  the rainfall. Although all electrical cords 
                                  and related cables have been elevated from the 
                                  now very wet ground, I must admit that working 
                                  off of a laptop connected by coaxial cable to 
                                  a satellite dish does present some concerns. 
                                  Said concerns center on the fact that if we 
                                  draw lightning or an electrical surge or short 
                                  circuit due to the humidity, we could have the 
                                  makings of a disaster on our hands. As I am 
                                  the only team member currently working online 
                                  or with any of the electronic equipment, the 
                                  risk to students has been eliminated...although 
                                  I must confess I pen these words with some trepidation 
                                  as the rains intensify at this moment.</p>

                                  This is a brief note to acknowledge that despite 
                                  intense rains and a very heavily overcast and 
                                  clouded sky, the DirecWay satellite signal stands 
                                  at between 67 and 68% signal strength. Otherwise, 
                                  despite the reduced signal strength, we are 
                                  transmitting without interruption. I am stopping 
                                  for now as the rains have turned into a downpour 
                                  and I need to secure the canopy and equipment 
                                  being used this day.</p>

                                  Today we were focused on the same essential 
                                  areas as last week (November 7, 2003). The primary 
                                  differences this day were the arrival of a reporter 
                                  from the Los Angeles Times -- Erwin Speiser. 
                                  Erwin arrived at about 9:30 am and stayed on 
                                  until about 11:30 am. The article being prepared 
                                  centers on the issue with the campus lab. Due 
                                  to intense rains, I will be clocking out and 
                                  the student crew, consisting of Marvin, Genetta, 
                                  Kyle, and Rob are holding down the canopy under 
                                  which I sit. Due to the amount of rain, they 
                                  will not be entering an online journal entry 
                                  this day. Signal strength in the midst of this 
                                  downpour is 83 % signal strength.</p>

                                  58, Room 140 of the CSU Monterey Bay campus. 
                                  This is the first official wireless linkage 
                                  from the new lab space that is currently being 
                                  assembled for the beginning of labs to commence 
                                  tomorrow in this new facility. Despite the fact 
                                  that we are only a couple of weeks from the 
                                  end of the term, the move necessitated by the 
                                  shutdown of the power grid in the old lab space 
                                  located in Building 110, has made it necessary 
                                  to postpone the final lab experiment for the 
                                  SBS 224s/324s flintknapping lab. The flintknapping 
                                  lab has in turn been moved to Building 58. Today, 
                                  Genetta Butler and I are moving supplies for 
                                  the flintknapping lab experiment from Building 
                                  110 to Building 58. Otherwise, this is the first 
                                  successful wireless connection from the new

                                  immediately connected and are working at optimal 
                                  performance as per wireless download and upload

                                  progress made on this very cold day, Unit B2 
                                  was initiated by Rob Lecel and Genetta Butler, 
                                  and Kyle Thompson has continued excavations 
                                  in Unit E4. That work now appears to have identified 
                                  the base of what was thought to be the Northwest 
                                  wall of the subterranean room tentatively identified 
                                  as the wine cellar. The wall extends down to 
                                  a depth of about 100 centimeters, however it 
                                  may well be that this in turn represents a re-enforcement 
                                  of the foundations to the Northwest wall of 
                                  the Sala area that today holds the sarcophagus 
                                  carved for Father Serra by Jo Mora. Due to the 
                                  amount of rainwater that saturated units E4 
                                  through H4, and a couple of adjacent units, 
                                  including Unit H1, archaeology at the site this 
                                  day has been slow going. The start of the day 
                                  in fact required the bailing of a considerable 
                                  amount of run off that filled the blue tarpaulin 
                                  used to shelter the area from the rains. The 
                                  tarpaulin, while reasonably successful in shedding 
                                  rainwater, nevertheless failed to catch waters 
                                  that flowed down the Northwest wall of Sala. 
                                  We will continue to about 4:00 pm this day, 
                                  and will again meet next week for the planned 
                                  Open House. The Open House normally features 
                                  posters sessions and related materials prepared 
                                  for said purpose. Depending on weather conditions, 
                                  the Open House may or may not be held.</p>

                                  Within Unit H1 Morgan Keach has recovered the 
                                  granite boulders and cobbles constituting the 
                                  foundation footing to the outer wall of the 
                                  Serra Library area. The wall measures approximately 
                                  60 centimeters in width (i.e., 57-60 cm). The 
                                  floors are composed of crushed mudstone upon 
                                  which indications of ladrillo flooring have 
                                  been recovered in some sectors. However, given 
                                  the very thin layer of trash and rubble filled 
                                  adobe (circa 10 centimeter deposit across breadth 
                                  of floor), I now believe that the so-called 
                                  Serra Library was &quot;dismantled&quot; prior 
                                  to the period of 1827. In 1827, Sykes depicts 
                                  the mission area in question less the Serra 
                                  Library area. The area being excavated in Unit 
                                  E4 contains a wall or foundation footing measuring 
                                  28 centimeters in width (as measured from the 
                                  adobe wall of the Sala)and extends to a depth 
                                  of approximately 80 centimeters from the top 
                                  of the foundation footing or wall in question. 
                                  Of course, if the foundation footing or wall 
                                  in question is only 80 centimeters in depth, 
                                  then it is unlikely to represent the northwest 
                                  wall of the Wine Cellar as originally anticipated. 
                                  At the same time, we are entering a layering 
                                  of material composed primarily of a very silty 
                                  sand with some sort of corroded metal deposit 
                                  in situ. Kyle Thompson is determined to expose 
                                  what currently appears to constitute a ball 
                                  of corroded metal that remains at the base of 
                                  the trench being worked to a depth of 100 centimeters 
                                  at this time.</p>

                                  It should be noted that today the laptops running 
                                  the wireless connection repeatedly disconnected. 
                                  The variable performance does not appear to 
                                  be related to the satellite configuration as 
                                  we were receiving signal strengths of up to 
                                  81% throughout the day. The very cold conditions 
                                  may have had something to do with the repeated 
                                  and almost incessant disconnects throughout 
                                  the day. Despite this, we managed to post wireless 
                                  journal entries throughout the day. Signal strength 
                                  at the moment is 84%.</p>

                                  Today is the last day of the Fall 2003 field 
                                  program at the Carmel Mission. Because our efforts 
                                  this day coincide with the end of year Capstone 
                                  festival for the Social and Behavioral Sciences, 
                                  we have a minimal crew of students on board 
                                  this day. In addition, because of final exam 
                                  and assessment commitments, David and Diane 
                                  are not on site this day. At the top of the 
                                  morning, I departed the site at about 8:45 am 
                                  in order to attend the Capstone Festival presentation 
                                  of archaeology program student Christopher Lack. 
                                  The presentation concerned the prospects, successes 
                                  and failures of the Wireless Technologies in 
                                  Archaeology project here at the Carmel Mission. 
                                  The presentation, which ran little more than 
                                  about 5 to 8 minutes summarized key initiatives 
                                  and presented some basic theory pertaining to 
                                  Chris' approach to interpreting results from 
                                  the project and the student interviews conducted 
                                  during the Spring 2003 term during which the 
                                  initial phases of the wireless project were 
                                  undertaken. In that context, Chris made note 
                                  of Cognitive Flexibility Theory and related 
                                  ideas regarding the importance and influence 
                                  of prior technology experience in influencing 
                                  perceptions of how it is that students and other 
                                  participants interpreted the success or satisfaction 
                                  with wireless technologies. On this last day 
                                  on site, which was originally to have included 
                                  an Open House, weather reports of rain and the 
                                  gathering storm clouds, have precluded our efforts 
                                  to setup an Open House for this term. In addition, 
                                  I found it necessary this day to contact the 
                                  DirecWay Support Desk at 1-866-347-3292 in order 
                                  to determine what problems afflicted the system 
                                  last week and this week. The technical support 
                                  person had us shut down the host computer after 
                                  asking a series of questions about the platform, 
                                  operating system, and modem connection and type. 
                                  We were then asked to disconnect the parallel 
                                  port cables connecting the upper and lower modem 
                                  boxes. We were then asked to reverse the order 
                                  of the parallel connectors. The technician then 
                                  asked that we disconnect the coaxial cable on 
                                  the upper modem; and then, upon notice to her 
                                  that it was connected, place a thumb over the 
                                  copper wire protruding from the coaxial cable 
                                  as she then set a timer for 30 seconds. Upon 
                                  notifying me to remove my thumb from the end 
                                  of the coaxial cable, she then had me repeat 
                                  this procedure for the lower coaxial cable. 
                                  The technician then explained that this was 
                                  a way of grounding and eliminating the buildup 
                                  of static electricity that had built up on the 
                                  lines and modem. Upon having completed the aforementioned 
                                  procedure, we were then directed to restart 
                                  the system. The system restarted almost immediately 
                                  and did so at 86% -- the highest signal strength 
                                  that we have obtained to date. However, the 
                                  university and Institute for Archaeology server 
                                  are nevertheless running at less than optimum 
                                  speed...perhaps due to capstone and end of term 
                                  assessments, finals, and the many file transfers 
                                  and uploads that typify the end of the term 
                                  at CSU Monterey Bay. The other problem that 
                                  we have encountered this day is with the second 
                                  laptop...which may well have a software problem 
                                  that we have been unable to resolve. I may again 
                                  contact the DirecWay technician, or have the 
                                  laptop reformatted as was done the last time 
                                  that such connectivity issues were a problem 
                                  during the Spring term. Because the second laptop 
                                  (ASTV2) has many additional files loaded, it 
                                  is likely that a software conflict may be the 
                                  source of the current problem with that laptopn. 
                                  Otherwise, our final task for the day will be 
                                  to have the students conduct an analysis of 
                                  the total amount of soil and material recovered 
                                  from each of those units excavated to date. 
                                  We will seek to come up with a figure for the 
                                  total cubic volume of materials removed from 
                                  each unit area.</p>

                                  This day's lab is the first formal lab of the 
                                  semester scheduled for students in Building 
                                  58, Room 137. As of last Thursday, the lab was 
                                  pulled together in record time with the delivery 
                                  of tables selected from the furniture warehouse 
                                  at CSUMB. The tables originally selected were 
                                  not delivered as they belonged to the Disability 
                                  Services group, and as such I was required to 
                                  re-select tables on Wednesday for delivery on 
                                  Thursday (the day before the first scheduled 
                                  lab of last Friday). The janitorial crews, telephone 
                                  technician, locksmith, and student assistants 
                                  were all on hand to clean tables, install phones, 
                                  move furniture, and organize a new lab space 
                                  on Thursday...and the job was done in record 
                                  time. We met with students last Friday morning 
                                  and no one lab student was aware of how close 
                                  we came to finding it necessary to cancel yet 
                                  another lab day. Today, lab assistants Genetta 
                                  Butler and Rob Lecel are working with students 
                                  to sort Carmel Mission project materials and 
                                  familiarize them with the types of specimens 
                                  likely to be recovered. Beginning tomorrow morning, 
                                  we are scheduled to begin excavations for yet 
                                  another term. All scheduled Thursday labs will 
                                  take place between the hours of 1:00 and 5:00 
                                  pm and will entail the use of wireless Tablet 
                                  PCs and Pocket PCs for data entry and journals 
                                  entered from the immediate confines of the wireless 
                                  lab in Building 58, Room 137. The new phone 
                                  numbers for the ASTV Mission Research Program 
                                  (Archaeology Lab) is 831-582-5380; and that 
                                  to the ASTV Technical Imaging Lab is 831-582-5381.</p>

                                  Date: 2004-02-20 04:36:40 Message: On this day 
                                  we initiated the Spring 2004 field season at 
                                  the Carmel Mission project site (CA-MNT-18). 
                                  A new group of about 27 students is matriculated 
                                  for the term, and we selected some six new units 
                                  for exploratory soundings. First, students were 
                                  asked to draw the numbers 1 through 8 from a 
                                  bucket, and then, depending on their priority 
                                  in the numbers from 1 through 8, students then 
                                  selected a second set of Unit numbers drawn 
                                  from a bucket. This then determined which students 
                                  groups were assigned to which units. Students 
                                  were permitted to self select their own team 
                                  members. They were also to select a Team leader 
                                  or captain. That individiual or team leader 
                                  then selected the Unit number from the bucket 
                                  of unit numbers. Having done that, students 
                                  were directed to produce notes describing their 
                                  respective unit areas. Having done that, they 
                                  were then instructed in basic procedures and 
                                  directed to initiate excavation procedures. 
                                  Rob Lecel, Genetta Butler and Kyle Thompson 
                                  assisted in directing students, and that info 
                                  provided the team leaders was then conveyed 
                                  through them and the project assistants to all 
                                  other students on an ongoing basis. Today we 
                                  opened six new units of those that remain. New 
                                  units include B2, E3, F4, H2, I1, and I4. In 
                                  addition to a single shard of Galera ware with 
                                  a tin-enameled interior, and a buff colored 
                                  exterior, was recovered by one group. A bird 
                                  skull, possibly a pelican, was recovered in 
                                  one of the units. The wireless system was successful 
                                  only to the extent that a single laptop was 
                                  on wireless...but wired to the modems. Apparently, 
                                  the technician believes that the access points 
                                  were somehow reset and settings deleted. We 
                                  will endeavor to correct this problem by next 
                                  week so that students are not in the position 
                                  of having to await others in inputting their 
                                  wireless journals. Otherwise, we had a very 
                                  successful day in so far as instruction and 
                                  training was concerned. The pastor has noted 
                                  that the otherwise torn and tattered plastic 
                                  frameworks that we use to cover the units are 
                                  an eyesore for wedding photographers. I have 
                                  offered to dismantle the PVC frameworks in question 
                                  and replace them with large tarps. The time 
                                  is 4:37 pm and we are preparing to depart.</p>

                                  Today, the SBS 260L/360L Archaeology Lab for 
                                  the Carmel Mission Project was conducted in 
                                  the Building 58, Room 137, CSU Monterey Bay 
                                  campus lab. About seven student project participants 
                                  were in lab from 2:00 to 5:00 pm. Specimens 
                                  processing, wireless catalog data entry, and 
                                  specimens photography in the Technical Imaging 
                                  Lab in Room 135 was the objective. The lab went 
                                  quite smoothly, and each student signed in on 
                                  the Mac laptop and then completed the day with 
                                  a Wireless Journal entry. Carolina Vicky Sordia, 
                                  a former Hartnell College volunteer and CSU 
                                  Monterey Bay student assistant, stopped by and 
                                  presented me with a Mickey Mouse version of 
                                  Indiana Jones...perhaps a subliminal message 
                                  was at hand? A couple of student appointments 
                                  were also had in Room 135. Despite heavy rains 
                                  yesterday and today, we are still anticipating 
                                  working out at the Carmel Mission project site 
                                  tommorrow. The time is 5:53 pm and only Genetta 
                                  Butler and Rob Lecel and I remain in lab to 
                                  see through shutting down operations for the 
                                  day. I am anticipating that tomorrow the student 
                                  technicians temporarily assigned me for the 
                                  Wireless Project will attempt to get me back 
                                  on line with those other computers, other than 
                                  the base station, that recently lost their access 
                                  point configurations. Last week, students were 
                                  left to post their journals from the base station. 
                                  Hopefully, the student technicians will resolve 
                                  the problem without further need for technical 
                                  intervention. Although Christian Graves, the 
                                  wireless technician and assistant who configured 
                                  the entire wireless setup for Carmel and San 
                                  Juan Bautista knows how to resolve the problem, 
                                  I have asked him to permit the student assistants 
                                  to take a stab at the problem so as to determine 
                                  whether or not they can figure out the problem 
                                  without Christian needing to intervene every 
                                  time a glitch arises.</p>

                                  I am sending this message from the Carmel Mission 
                                  courtyard via wireless laptop-based satellite 
                                  mediated Internet connection. I am here with 
                                  Christian Graves, the wireless technician who 
                                  configured the original wireless setup used 
                                  here at the Carmel Mission. During the course 
                                  of the past month, the Wireless Archaeology 
                                  Demonstration Project has been forced to have 
                                  some 28 matriculated students work from a single 
                                  wireless laptop base station due to the fact 
                                  that we lost connectivity at the beginning of 
                                  the term, and the university technicians sent 
                                  to correct the problem were unable to find the 
                                  source of the problem. Unfortunately, the student 
                                  technician sent us was not provided advanced 
                                  training and was not prepared to address the 
                                  needs. After efforts by a host of other technicians 
                                  also failed, I coordinated with Christian Graves 
                                  to reconfigure the wireless setup and thereby 
                                  reconnect the Internet for the laptop and tablet 
                                  PC operating stations being used here at the 
                                  mission. Christian spent an evening assessing 
                                  the Internet and satellite configuration for 
                                  the existing equipment, and immediately determined 
                                  that tech support had reconfigured the equipment 
                                  incorrectly. Christian reconfigured the main 
                                  base station so that it would read the Direcway 
                                  signal, and did so via telephone linkup from 
                                  his home. Today, Christian and I arrived on 
                                  site here at the Carmel Mission at about 2:30 
                                  pm. However, due to the lack of the immediate 
                                  availability of an appropriate surge protector, 
                                  cabling, and replacement coaxial cable connectors 
                                  and tools, it became necessary to purchase nearly 
                                  $100 in equipment. Christian began work on the 
                                  on-site reconnect and reconfiguration of the 
                                  laptops and tablet PCs at 3:00 pm, and by 5:15 
                                  pm we were up and running on all equipment. 
                                  This is the first time since January that we 
                                  have been able to run all equipment via &quot;wireless&quot; 
                                  since campus assigned tech support took over 
                                  support of the Carmel Mission Wireless Archaeology 
                                  Demonstration Project. As with all other experimental 
                                  outcomes on this project, it is clear from the 
                                  outcomes experienced in this instance that trained 
                                  technicians with proficiency in wireless configurations 
                                  must be at hand to support wireless technology 
                                  projects of this kind.</p>

                                  Today, during the course of the Archaeology 
                                  Lab in Building 58, Rooms 135 and 137, approximately 
                                  seven students participated in the scheduled 
                                  Thursday afternoon lab time. We moved forward 
                                  on processing, cataloguing, and identifying 
                                  materials collected from the Carmel Mission 
                                  excavation. Christian Graves, our wireless technician, 
                                  reconfigured the laptops and tablet PCs for 
                                  use on site at Carmel. At first, here in the 
                                  on-campus lab, we had some connectivity issues. 
                                  While it was clear that we were picking up the 
                                  wireless signal available here in the building, 
                                  we were unable to get onto the Internet. However, 
                                  Dennis Yu (an SBS 360s student) tracked the 
                                  problem to the LANN settings in Internet Explorer. 
                                  To correct this problem, go to Internet Explorer's 
                                  &quot;Internet Options,&quot; then &quot;Connections,&quot; 
                                  then &quot;LAN Settings,&quot; and uncheck &quot;Proxy 
                                  Server&quot; check box. Recheck &quot;Proxy 
                                  Server&quot; when laptops and Tablet PCs are 
                                  used with the wireless network on site at Carmel. 
                                  We are wrapping up for the day, and Genetta 
                                  is headed to the office to prepare copies while 
                                  I organize 35mm transparency images from my 
                                  Missions Solstice Survey conducted during the 
                                  month of January, 2004. Today, I received an 
                                  email from Mardith Schuetz-Miller, the Mission 
                                  studies scholar out of Tucson, and she is rather 
                                  intrigued with the solstice work that I am doing 
                                  and is quite excited about seeing that I have 
                                  that work published. Tomorrow, we will be back 
                                  on site at the Carmel Mission. Otherwise, the 
                                  lab day was particularly productive and went 
                                  off without a hitch...other than the delay occasioned 
                                  by the fact that we needed to figure out the 
                                  Proxy Server check off for use in the campus 
                                  lab.</p>

                                  Not a Wireless Post: This post is being submitted 
                                  from my campus office machine...due to the fact 
                                  that at approximately 5:00 pm we lost satellite 
                                  connectivity due to a Direcway problem not related 
                                  to our existing setup. The warning message indicated 
                                  that we had lost our satellites. Rather than 
                                  wait for a reconnect, I decided to pack up and 
                                  head over here to the office to post this brief 
                                  message. I was in the midst of a much longer 
                                  message that was all but transmitted when the 
                                  outage took place. Despite the fact that I invested 
                                  another $150.00 in having Christian Graves reconfigure 
                                  the wireless setup, and it worked with great 
                                  efficiency last Tuesday there at the Carmel 
                                  Mission, and yesterday during wireless transmissions 
                                  from the Archaeology Lab in Building 58, the 
                                  student tech sent by the campus attempted to 
                                  configure the base station with a cross-over 
                                  cable and when she was unable to get connectivity, 
                                  instead changed critical IPconfig settings on 
                                  the base station and secondary machines. This 
                                  resulted in perhaps one of the most frustrating 
                                  days yet at the site. We lost that connectivity 
                                  and configuration that had been reestablished 
                                  by Christian Graves. As a result, our first 
                                  opportunity to go wireless on something other 
                                  than the base station was lost. I contacted 
                                  Christian Graves by cell phone from Carmel, 
                                  and he offered to drive on out from Salinas 
                                  to correct the problem...and that after he attempted 
                                  to walk me through the corrections over the 
                                  cell phone. Christian arrived on site at about 
                                  2:45 pm and by 3:00 pm he had scanned all IPconfig 
                                  settings, corrected them, reset original wireless 
                                  network settings, and had us up and running 
                                  on wireless on both laptops and both Tablet 
                                  PCs. The archaeology students who benefitted 
                                  from Christian's efforts were quite amazed at 
                                  his prowess in reestablishing our network, particularly 
                                  as the university technician who created the 
                                  problem spent the entire period from 8:30 am 
                                  until her departure at noon attempting to correct 
                                  the problem...and that, to no avail.</p>

                                  The time is 7:05 pm and I am remitting this 
                                  post via the CSUMB Building 58 Archaeology Lab 
                                  wireless network. Once again, the availability 
                                  of an open lab worked wonderfully, and students 
                                  were able to advance their respective projects 
                                  and complete with required lab times so as to 
                                  address the SCI ULR. Among the more interesting 
                                  specimens is one earthenware shard, of probably 
                                  Galera or Mexican ware type, that has a fabric 
                                  or other impression ingrained into its surface. 
                                  In the same unit area, Unit F2 (Genetta Butler, 
                                  Kyle Thompson, and Rob Lecel) was recovered 
                                  a two by two centimeter piece of material with 
                                  a similar fabric like impression. However, the 
                                  piece, upon closer inspection, resembles some 
                                  sort of tar or pitch...possibly applied to the 
                                  vessel in question with a fabric impression. 
                                  Will wonders never cease...we will look into 
                                  this further during and after the Spring Break 
                                  of next week.</p>

                                  This email is being transmitted from a wireless 
                                  Tablet PC via satellite transmission from the 
                                  Carmel Mission (CA-MNT-18) archaeology excavation 
                                  area (Structure 1, Unit C2). Due to technical 
                                  problems occasioned by the repeated failure 
                                  of the Compaq Evo laptops being used for the 
                                  project, we have repeatedly found it necessary 
                                  to reformat the laptops...thereby losing wireless 
                                  configuration settings in the process. Because 
                                  the university assigned a student technician 
                                  back in February to support our wireless project, 
                                  I chose not to call in my nephew Christian Graves 
                                  to get us back on line. My goal was to determine 
                                  by way of this ongoing demonstration project 
                                  and experiment...whether or not we might be 
                                  supported by campus student technicians, and 
                                  whether or not the project was sustainable without 
                                  further project resources or equipment support. 
                                  Due to the fact that the project with HP did 
                                  not include monies to train the existing student 
                                  assistants in wireless technologies deployment, 
                                  the student technicians assigned to support 
                                  us were unable to get us back on line for the 
                                  whole of the seven site days that we have had 
                                  since February. As noted in previous posts, 
                                  I finally called Christian Graves back to the 
                                  site on a Tuesday to reconfigure the system. 
                                  He had everything running within a period of 
                                  less than two hours. This required that he reconfigure 
                                  all IPconfig settings from memory...etc. Despite 
                                  asking the campus project supervisor to reassign 
                                  our student technician, particularly as I felt 
                                  it was unfare to her (and us) to send her out 
                                  without the proper training, she arrived on 
                                  site last Friday and promptly went about attempting 
                                  to connect to wireless without proper consultation 
                                  with those of us more aware of the system and 
                                  its limitations. As a result, before anything 
                                  could be done, the student tech reset all of 
                                  the IPconfig settings without consultation and 
                                  we were off line for the whole of the morning. 
                                  After the tech's departure, I contacted Christian 
                                  Graves, and after the 45 minute drive from Salinas, 
                                  he arrived on site at about 3:00 pm and had 
                                  us back on line in a matter of 15 minutes. Today, 
                                  we found that the system was not getting us 
                                  online, however, in this instance it turned 
                                  out to be the campus network that went down 
                                  due to the failure of a security firewall. We 
                                  contacted CSUMBs IT division and they informed 
                                  us of the problem...but not after I spent about 
                                  an hour and a half attempting a trouble-shoot. 
                                  I soon determined that the problem was not at 
                                  our end...and hand Rob Lecel contact DirecWay 
                                  for support. We learned that it was not with 
                                  Direcway, but the campus servers...particularly 
                                  after the Internet began firing back Server 
                                  Outage errors. Today, we had all four computers 
                                  (both laptops and both Tablet PCs) back online. 
                                  However, as with other problems that we have 
                                  recurrently had with the Compaq laptops, the 
                                  secondary ASTV2 laptop has repeatedly crashed 
                                  and lost its wireless connection. We are able 
                                  to remedy this by way of restarting the laptop 
                                  as often as needed. As for the archaeology, 
                                  we had a productive and interesting day...with 
                                  several shell and glass trade beads being recovered, 
                                  as well as two shards of San Augustin Blue-on-White 
                                  (1575-1650). These latter shards are likely 
                                  part of an heirloom vessel that turned up at 
                                  Carnel in the colonial era. Kyle Thompson first 
                                  exposed a deer scapula last Friday, March 12th. 
                                  The deer scapula was found in association with 
                                  a flaked chert tool in direct association. As 
                                  of a couple of minutes ago, Kyle Thompson (Unit 
                                  F2, Level 4) reported that he has identified 
                                  a second chert tool immediately below the deer 
                                  scapula. This fact leads me to believe that 
                                  Esselen or other local area Costanoan peoples 
                                  butchered a deer with stone tools, and lit a 
                                  fire within a rock-ringed hearth located within 
                                  the immediately adjacent G2 and H3 units. Several 
                                  large stones recovered from that area, and atop 
                                  the adobe wall fall or melt were heavily burned 
                                  as though exposed to the flames of a long-term 
                                  hearth. Unit F4 produced a nicely pedestalled 
                                  and layered collection of teja fragments, bone, 
                                  and related debris. Interestingly, that material 
                                  overlies that area adjacent the wall of the 
                                  Serra Cenotaph Room that we originally assumed 
                                  required the digging of a trench in the 1920s 
                                  to reconstitute with cement mortar. Further 
                                  excavation will bear out the facts there. Unit 
                                  I1 has produced several interesting materials, 
                                  including the San Augustin Blue-on-White shards 
                                  and fragments of bone at floor level. In fact, 
                                  the bone fragment at the floor is immediately 
                                  atop the floor and is likely debris from prir 
                                  to the collapse or abandonment of the roomblock. 
                                  At this point in my analysis, I have every reason 
                                  to believe that the so-called Serra Library 
                                  (Structures 1 &amp; 2) was constructed some 
                                  time about 1790 and dismantled shortly after 
                                  the earthquake of 1812. The structure itself 
                                  may have been damaged in the earthquake, but 
                                  it is more likely that the extensive repairs 
                                  necessitated on the facade of the Santa Lucia 
                                  Sandstone Church required the demolition of 
                                  said building for the purposes noted. One last 
                                  observation concerns the fact that we may have 
                                  indications of a doorway at Unit I1 in that 
                                  the foundation and flooring indicate a pattern 
                                  reminiscent of such doorway features in other 
                                  related sites.</p>

                                  Despite an initial delay on getting connected 
                                  to the wireless network via satellite (due to 
                                  a campus server firewall failure) the wireless 
                                  system worked well this day. Given that we have 
                                  gone nearly seven days in the field without 
                                  the use of anything more than one wireless base 
                                  station for 25 or so students, today was a welcome 
                                  relief. All students were able to post their 
                                  journal entries...with some delays due to a 
                                  campus server outage at midday. The time is 
                                  4:58 pm and only Genetta Butler, Kyle Thompson, 
                                  Rob Lecel, and Johanna remain on site to shut 
                                  down and pack up the gear for the day. We will 
                                  not likely be on site for the next three weeks 
                                  as Spring Break runs through next week, the 
                                  following week I will be in Montreal, Canada, 
                                  for the annual Society for American Archaeology 
                                  meetings, and the following week we will very 
                                  likely run a lab session devoted to final projects 
                                  (in part due to Good Friday devotions here at 
                                  the Mission). Our next postings will not likely 
                                  take place until on or around April 7th and 
                                  8th.</p>

                                  This is not a wireless post: This post is being 
                                  transmitted from the Ethernet linked computer 
                                  in the Building 58 &quot;Technical Imaging Lab.&quot; 
                                  As today is Good Friday, and we wish to respect 
                                  this day as a day of obligation for the parishioners 
                                  and visitors of the Carmel Mission, I designated 
                                  this a lab day for students. The majority of 
                                  the field class attended this day's lab, but 
                                  in each instance individual students participated 
                                  to varying degrees as per actual time commitment. 
                                  Overall, this was a very productive lab day 
                                  and in at least two instances, Unit crews managed 
                                  to complete with all specimens data entry into 
                                  the online database or Wireless Site Catalog 
                                  Tool. Because the majority of the computers 
                                  used today are in fact linked to the Internet 
                                  via wireless connectivity, all other transmissions 
                                  this day were via wireless connection. The prime 
                                  objectives of the day were to (a) complete specimens 
                                  processing, (b) weigh and or re-weigh specimens 
                                  with the new, more accurate, lab scales now 
                                  available to us, (c)make use of lab and field 
                                  guides, specimens manuals, Internet type collections, 
                                  and the &quot;Mission Ceramics&quot; CD-Rom 
                                  to correctly identify unit specimens, (d) data 
                                  entry and or editing, (e)digital imaging or 
                                  photography of distinctive specimens, and (f) 
                                  archival storage and processing. To accommodate 
                                  the number of students this day, we moved the 
                                  second photo copy stand into the Technical Imaging 
                                  Lab, and placed one additional table into the 
                                  lab. The metal shelf unit formerly placed in 
                                  the Technical Imaging Lab is now located in 
                                  Room 58-140. As we received the new metric scales 
                                  while I was away in Montreal, Canada, at the 
                                  Society for American Archaeology meetings, we 
                                  have since made these available for lab use. 
                                  The availability of these new larger, and smaller, 
                                  capacity metric scales allowed for a much more 
                                  efficient measurement of the weight of individual 
                                  specimens. In addition, I had one student make 
                                  use of the &quot;Maiolica Ceramics&quot; Acrobat 
                                  .pdf file (Cohen-Williams and Williams, 2004)in 
                                  order to more precisely type specimens not clearly 
                                  noted from the &quot;Mission Ceramics&quot; 
                                  CD. Unfortunately, the student who made use 
                                  of the Acrobat file felt that it was a bit too 
                                  difficult to use as an electronic guide. The 
                                  amount of detail, while great, was a bit too 
                                  much for basic lab use. Beyond that, I believe 
                                  that the &quot;Maiolica&quot; file should be 
                                  quite useful in the future to working up more 
                                  detailed characterizations of those elements 
                                  of the collection specific to maiolica. That 
                                  file now resides on the Archaeology Lab computer 
                                  in Room 58-140. Finally, on a technical note, 
                                  data entry into the Wireless Type Collections 
                                  saw a slight modification this day to the field 
                                  category titled Unit. Instead of entering data 
                                  in the format of G3 for instance, we have added 
                                  a dash so as to segregate the letter from the 
                                  number (e.g., G-3). Also, today we made use 
                                  of the strobe system to provide a cleaner light 
                                  source for the digital imaging. The use of the 
                                  bulbs in the existing motorized Varispeed 1000 
                                  copy stand produce a yellow cast or color shift. 
                                  The strobe, with umbrellas, produces a softer 
                                  and more accurate light (and that with the shades 
                                  drawn on the windows). Unlike our work at San 
                                  Juan Bautista, we have since taken to organizing 
                                  the catalogued collection into archival boxes 
                                  by material type. Previously, we had taken to 
                                  organizing by catalog number in ascending order. 
                                  This earlier system proved ponderous. The new 
                                  system, initiated with the move to the Building 
                                  58 Archaeology Lab has proven much more efficient 
                                  thanks to Genetta Butler's efforts.</p>
