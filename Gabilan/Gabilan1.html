GABILAN CONSERVATION CAMP #38

-----------------------


California Department of Corrections (CDC)
In Cooperation with
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF)

Gabilan Conservation Camp CC #38

FIRE CREW RESPOND TO FIRES, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES, SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS

California's Conservation Camp Program Fire Crew, also known as hand crews, provides the muscle that enables CDF to achieve the Department's mission.  A primary objective within the mission is to "reduce life, property, and natural resource losses through the implementation of balanced fire prevention, fire protection planning, presuppression, and suppression activities".  Fire Crews are the platoons of foot soldiers on the "front line" day and night, when California experiences one of her natural or human caused disasters, or one of her burgeoning number of minor emergencies that occur on a daily basis.  The Fire Crews are completely mobile throughout the state, and are strategically located in areas that are most likely to need their assistance.

The Fire Crew Firefighters assigned to these crews are highly trained and motivated, well organized within each crew unit, well supervised by permanently assigned personnel, and well cared for by the custodial agency responsible for their health and welfare.  They are carefully screened by their cooperating agencies for their suitability for the program including physical, emotional, and intellectual aptitude, as well as a lack of violent crime, sex offenses, and arson in their records.  Potential crew members are evaluated again during physical fitness training which consists of a week of field use, teamwork, and crew expectations.  Once assigned to a Fire Crew, a minimum of 4 hours-per-week of advanced training is provided to each Fire Crew Firefighter with some members progressing to more responsible positions on the crew.

THE PROGRAM

Gabilan Conservation Camp is one of 39 CDF Conservation Camps, statewide, housing over 4,000 inmates and wards including 33 camps (31 male camps, 2 female camps) providing 159 crews in cooperation with the California Department of Corrections (CDC); and 6 camps, 29 crews (28 male crews, 1 female crew) in cooperation with the California Department of the Youth Authority.  In addition to the Conservation Camp Program, CDF is involved in a Fire Center Agreement with the California Conservation Corps for two fire centers providing 7 mixed gender Fire Crews.  In all, CDF maintains 95 type 1 Fire Crews, year round.

EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES

All CDF Fire Crews are tested each spring during Fire Crew Preparedness Exercises.  These exercises consist of several wild land firefighting evolutions, stressing teamwork and safety.  They also take on a certain air of competition.  Basic preparedness exercise sequences include equipment readiness, knowledge of firefighting and safety principles, physical condition.  Crew members and their crew carrying vehicles have been thoroughly inspected. Crew members have hiked 4 miles in 65 minutes with full gear and tools, have cut 100 yards of fire line through brush, and some have extended 1,000 feet of progressive hose lay, and constructed a safety zone and deployed a fire shelter.  Some exercises include working with live fire, helicopters, bulldozers, and other emergency related evolutions.  CDF Fire crews are available 12 months-per-year.  Consequently, they have become California's storm troopers, logging in some 426,090 hours of flood fighting in January of 1997 alone.

All of California's major disasters over the last few years have seen the assistance of the fire crews in either a labor intensive effort to contain and mitigate the situation, such as the fire, heavy snow, search and rescue operations, earthquakes and floods, or in more of a support role, such as staffing a mobile kitchen unit during the Los Angeles riots.

On fires, building "freeways" with chain saws and hand tools through whatever vegetation happens to be in the line of fire is normal crew routine.  However, direct attack is the tactic of choice when real estate between the fire and life and property becomes scarce.  Sometimes, right at the burning edge of the fire is the safest place to be.  You will also see these crews ahead of the line fire preparing structures for the inevitable fire front, firing out as it approaches, and securing the structures after frontal passage.  Other Fire Crew activities one can witness, if they venture away from the pavement, is hot-spotting, or attacking faster burning or particularly threatening areas of the fire, providing support for air attack operations, extending hose lays, mop-up, and patrol.  All this for $1.00 per hour of emergency pay, plus room (a sleeping bag and a foam pad) and board.  Person-days expended on emergency incident in 1996 by Fire Crew members totaled 266,542; and in 1995 the total was 223,378.  CDF had a slow year with only 177,625; but in 1994, the total was 324,867 person-days.

FRINGE BENEFITS

The citizens of California reap a significant benefit, fiscally, by housing their low risk inmates and wards in the conservation camps, where there are no walls or gun towers.  Many of the inmates and wards receive a new lease on life at camp where they learn honest skills and work ethics that will serve them well after their prison stay.  Another taxpayer benefit is the labor these "campers" provide in their performance of conservation related projects for the various agencies of government.  Basically, this is free labor, with Fire Crew Captain supervision, for work projects that would not otherwise be affordable.  In 1995, Fire Crew members performed 104,509 person-days of labor for federal agencies, 127,962 person days of labor for local agencies.  CDF is careful not to compete or displace private enterprise in the approval, scheduling, and conduct of these jobs.

Conservation camps and fire centers provide community services and source of income to many small communities and sparsely populated, located within a few miles of small population center.  It will have a civil service staff of at least 24 employees between CDF and CDC (or other cooperating agency), and will field 5 Fire Crews.  Combined budget for the typical camp, including both agencies, payrolls and operating costs, is about $2 million.  Many of the goods and services required for operation of the conservation camp will be purchased from local vendors, and it is common for staff and inmates to be active, involved members of local community, such an in PROJECT STRAIGHT FORWARD, which has been recognized as a literacy advocate organization that fights against drugs, gangs, and violence throughout our communities.
